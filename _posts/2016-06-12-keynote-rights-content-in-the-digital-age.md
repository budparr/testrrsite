At this half-day event, “Rights and Content in the Digital Age,” leading experts in the book and media industries — including literary agents, publishers and digital service providers — will highlight cutting-edge strategies to help you maximize your IP and grow your rights business.

In this digital age, when all backlist is frontlist, publishers are leaving money on the table while also opening themselves up to potential liability by not keeping better focus on the rights and licenses they hold.
