With Ann Goldstein, Roxana Robinson, Judith Thurman &bull; Italian novelist Elena Ferrante has become a worldwide sensation with her Neapolitan novels. Ferranteâ€™s longtime English-language translator joins Festival authors to discuss the work of this famously enigmatic author, and her collection of essays and letters Bits and Pieces of Uncertain Origin, coming out in April.
