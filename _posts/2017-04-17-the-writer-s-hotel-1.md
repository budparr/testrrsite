The Writer's Hotel is a hybrid writers conference that meets each June at a floating campus between three hotels in Midtown Manhattan. TWH is unique. We work with each writer on their writing, for months before our conference. On site in NYC in June, writers attend large and small workshops, agent pitch meetings, editor lectures and genre labs. And each writer gets to read their own work in the city! 2017 venues are KGB Bar Lit, KGB Bar Lit's Red Room, The Cornelia Street Café and The Bowery. Faculty read at The Half King and Kinokuniya. NYC literary history is brought to life by the walking tours we offer, led by NYPL docents and the Dorothy Parker Society. We also host a spectacular game of Wink, Murder at The Algonquin Hotel.
