  quote: The writers gathered in these pages are among the finest, and the material
    they are working with is, by its nature, powerful and compelling. The result is
    stories that are by turns brutal and hilarious, dark and redemptive. Every one
    of them speaks to a truth we should not, cannot, turn away from.

  quote: Roxana Robinson’s *Sparta* is a feat of the imagination. Vividly and with
    unflinching wisdom, Robinson has given voice, substance, and profound reality
    to her protagonist Conrad Farrell of the Marine Corps—and in so doing to thousands
    of veterans like him.

  quote: The energy here, and the drama of the book, is all about the tension of inhabiting
    a damaged mind as it attempts to right itself, through discipline, through rage,
    through alcohol, through family, and through therapy. The ups and downs of that
    long and harrowing journey home make *Sparta* a riveting and important contribution
    to the literature of the Iraq War and to anti-war literature in general.
