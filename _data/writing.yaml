  content: "“I think I started reading Alice Munro in the early 1980s. I think the first book was <em>The Lives of Girls and Women</em>. It was an odd title, but I was drawn to it, because, if you’re a woman, that title reminds you that your own experience is different from others – by others I mean men, whose experience dominates the literary world—and suggests that your experience merits its own book.”"
