  content: "“I think I started reading Alice Munro in the early 1980s. I think the
    first book was *The Lives of Girls and Women*. It was an odd title, but I was
    drawn to it, because, if you’re a woman, that title reminds you that your own
    experience is different from others – by others I mean men, whose experience dominates
    the literary world—and suggests that your experience merits its own book.”"
