 "Roxana Robinson is surely one of the most graceful stylists and psychologically perceptive writers working. <em>Cost </em>approaches the subject of drugs’ impact from an original and very significant angle. This book shows further the extent of Robinson’s insights into the whirl, the generational ironies at work, and the desperate indulgences to which we turn in our confusion. <em>Cost</em> is an important, timely book that furthers insight into our present fortunes and dilemmas."
