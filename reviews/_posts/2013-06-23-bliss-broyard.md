“The editors of an influential British anthology recently set off a debate in the pages of <em>The Guardian</em> that spread through the literary blogosphere. In their introduction to ‘New Writing 13,’ Toby Litt and Ali Smith remarked that ‘on the whole, the submissions from women were disappointingly domestic...as if too many women writers have been injected with a special drug that keeps them dulled, good, saying the right thing, aping the right shape, and melancholy at doing it, depressed as hell.’ Trying to subdue the ensuing firestorm, Litt and Smith later argued that they didn't object to domestic subjects per se but to ‘the lack of risk-taking in the writing itself.’ (Back in 1998, in <em>Harper’s</em> magazine, Francine Prose addressed a similar perception of American women writers.)

“The 13 stories in Roxana Robinson’s new collection—which explore relationships between people, usually family members, without benefit of flip-book-style illustrations, footnotes, or other daredevilry of fashionable form—brand her as just the type of woman writer the editors of ‘New Writing 13’ might hastily dismiss as ‘disappointingly domestic.’ And that would be a loss, because the best stories in <em>A Perfect Stranger</em> illuminate those sudden, mysterious internal shifts that allow us to feel forgiveness or the weight of our errors, that alchemize envy into admiration, shame into triumph, that carry us across the spectrum of human experience in a single moment even as they remind us of the fecundity of everyday life.

“Robinson manages this feat by paying close attention to the nuances that reveal people’s interior lives, a trait that she often bestows on her characters. The narrator of ‘Family Christmas,’ recalling her childhood attempts to understand her parents’ conversation and, by extension, the adult world, recognizes that this information ‘had to be absorbed’ through ‘signs, inflections, looks and sighs and tones of voice.’ When the husband of her grandparents’ cook drunkenly confronts her <em>grandpère</em>, the narrator intuits more about the scene than she realizes: ‘Part of what I felt was shame....Shame for other people’s misery, shame that it had lain naked and exposed before us, shame that we’d seen it.’ By having the child, not the adults, register this truth, Robinson suggests that we can become less perceptive as we grow older, through our willful inurement to life’s inequities and despair.

“Robinson, who is also the author of three novels, two previous story collections, and a biography of Georgia O’Keeffe, is particularly good at charting the ebb and flow of affection and fury within relationships. In the title story, a husband and wife privately feud while playing host to an opera scholar for the weekend. Jeffrey, whose wife, Martha, agreed to put up this ‘perfect stranger’ without consulting him, ‘felt ill used, and also rather noble, for rising so well to the occasion.’ In the kitchen, he reassures their guest that having him stay is ‘our pleasure,’ while in the privacy of his bathroom he slams the lid of the laundry hamper in a petulant display. For her part, Martha is too concerned with impressing the local music festival’s lectures committee to acknowledge her part in her husbands passive-aggressive behavior. But when an emergency—their keys locked in the car—forces them back into solidarity, Martha recognizes the fluctuations that characterize, even strengthen, their marriage: ‘They were in this, whatever it was, together, both of them struggling with the waves of emotion, both carrying burdens of anger and love.’

“In the genteel orbit of Robinson’s stories, people fight against being ‘hemmed in by a jostling throng of rules and expectations’ and try to overcome a brooding disenchantment with their lives. Occasionally, you can feel the author’s hand too firmly on her characters’ backs, pushing them toward tidy resolutions. In the first pages of ‘The Football Game,’ the teenage narrator’s unmitigated admiration for her roommate’s parents—whose pastimes of tailgating, martini drinking, and garden-club meetings seem reassuringly normal compared with those of her shaggy-haired, abstract-expressionist painter father and bohemian-style yet oddly prim mother—telegraph an imminent reversal of positions. More often, though, Robinson remains in the background, quietly allowing her meticulous observations to convey the quotidian in all its perfect strangeness."
