 “Dramatic, fast-paced, boasting both engaging characters and an optimistic resolution of its conflict, this well-written novel will make good summer reading. It explores contemporary family life and relationships on a number of levels as its protagonist, Laura, seeks to come to terms with her roles as woman, mother, sister, aunt, daughter, wife, and lover. On vacation in Maine with her small son, her lover, and her sister’s family, and contending with a visit from her estranged husband, Laura is forced to evaluate these various, often-conflicting roles. Although the novel is undemanding and its solutions seem glib and easy, the pleasant style and the author’s control of her subject recommend it."
