“Reading <em>Sweetwater</em>, a novel by Roxana Robinson (<em>This Is My Daughter</em>), is a lot like watching an Olympic diver. We are vaguely aware of the structure and form that holds the diver’s efforts together and yet entranced with the beauty presented.

“Abundant in poetic language and incisive imagery, Robinson unfolds what seems, at first, to be a subdued story about relationships and love but which slowly reveals ever-dilating depth and breadth.

Robinson frames this vista with an expertly constructed narrative. And when she pulls off the ending with breathtaking skill, the effect is utterly satisfying."
