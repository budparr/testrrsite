 "Roxana Robinson’s amazing new novel is about insightful people who go too long without introspecting and about judicious people who quite simply make errors in judgment. I love the way her characters come to consciousness and the way the reader is always brought up short along with them. Reading it, I felt sure we’re all in this together: our defenses quickly invoked only to be worn down, while at the same time we were increasingly experiencing life with our eyes wide open—with the hope held out by the author that eventually our hearts might open as well. It’s a very impressive book."
