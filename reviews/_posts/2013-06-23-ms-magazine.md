  - "[T]he first sensible discussion of how photography influenced O’Keeffe’s painting."
---
 “Chockablock with intriguing detail, some apt insight, and best of all, O’Keeffe’s own voice—in her letters—and in the words of her family and friends who wouldn’t talk to anyone before the artist’s death at the age of 98 in 1986. It gives us the first sensible discussion of how photography influenced O’Keeffe’s painting—her close-ups, wide angles, cropping, distortion of scale, and zooms."
