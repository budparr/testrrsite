 "<em>Cost</em> is a gritty portrait of the havoc wreaked upon a family by one member’s drug addiction. Roxana Robinson’s vivid, sensuous prose moves effortlessly among relationships and points of view, evoking a brutal war between familial love—in its infinite power and mystery—and the mechanical devastations of pathology."
