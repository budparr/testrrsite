 "Robinson’s fifth novel (following <em>Cost</em>) is a detailed examination of the inner life of a Marine returning home after combat... Robinson brings us deep inside Conrad’s soul, and inside the suffocating despair and frustration that can stalk soldiers even when they are ostensibly out of harm’s way. By letting the reader live in Conrad’s skin, Robinson creates a moving chronicle of how we fail our returning troops."
