 "Triple-threat author Robinson—she’s written a novel (<em>Summer Light</em>, LJ 6/1/88), a story collection ( <em>A Glimpse of Scarlet and Other Stories</em>, LJ 6/1/91), and a biography (Georgia O’Keeffe, LJ 9/15/89)—continues her investigation of the upper crust in a new collection of short fiction."
