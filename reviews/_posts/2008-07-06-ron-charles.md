“<em>Cost</em> will get tagged immediately as that story about heroin addiction, but what’s best about Roxana Robinson’s scarily good novel has nothing to do with opiates. Oh, she’s done her homework well, and she writes about every aspect of the drug—its use, its effects, and especially its personal, financial, and spiritual costs—with flesh-itching precision. But if heroin is what gives this novel its rush, Robinson’s sensitivity to family relations is what makes it so compelling.

“Most of the story takes place at a seaside house in Maine. For Julia, an artist and art professor, this was meant to be a tranquil vacation with her elderly parents, but those plans are quickly swept aside. On his way home from Seattle, her elder son, Steven, stops in Brooklyn to see his younger brother, Jack. Immediately, he realizes something is wrong. Drugs had always been part of Jack’s life, but now “he looked terrible; pale, very thin. Dark stubble stood out against his white skin....Jack’s presence seemed dead, flattened. No light came from him, the air around him was inert." When Steven arrives at his mother's house, he reluctantly tells her what he suspects. Julia calls her ex-husband, who brings Jack to the house in Maine, and together the whole family begins a faltering, panicked process of intervention, counseling, and treatment that absorbs all their lives."
