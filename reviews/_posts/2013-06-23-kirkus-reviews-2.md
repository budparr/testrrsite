 "Fourteen finely wrought and revealing stories about the not-so-gentle sting of WASP-y love, from novelist (<em>Summer Light</em>) and biographer (Georgia O’Keeffe) Robinson. In ‘The Time for Kissing,’ a grown daughter, Susannah, sorts through images from her past in an effort to come to some sort of understanding with her willfully remote mother. Just as Susannah is ready to risk it—to try to cross old barricades of correctness—her mother manages to rebuff her in a final and desperately sad fashion."
