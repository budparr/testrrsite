"Does much to give body to the O’Keeffe myth. The author presents a person who was both vulnerable and fierce, passionate and coolly withholding, sensuous yet oddly unsexual. Benefiting from the O’Keeffe family’s cooperation, Ms. Robinson…draws on correspondence that was inaccessible to scholars during the artist’s lifetime. Ms. Robinson assiduously interviewed people who knew O’Keeffe and deftly collated masses of information."
