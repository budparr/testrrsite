“Roxana Robinson often writes about the privileged, and one of her strengths is evoking sympathy for people who seem to have every advantage yet suffer nonetheless. She visits this territory again in a fine collection of short stories that explores with delicacy, wit, and a good deal of empathy, the angst that afflicts the comfortable.

“Robinson is particularly adept at writing about women who have grown up cosseted as well as constricted by their belief that life has rules that ought to be obeyed, even as they see others thrive—or seem to—by breaking free.

“In the first of the collection’s 13 stories, ‘Family Christmas,’ a young girl visiting her wealthy grandparents witnesses a shouting match between her proper grandfather and the crude husband of the beloved family housekeeper, an encounter the child knows is important, although she cannot say why. She is clear on one point: some things are not meant to be discussed: ‘You had to be careful in talking to grown-ups, it was like talking to foreigners....I waited for the next thing that would happen, for the grown-ups to take charge again. I didn’t understand these things, and I knew that no one would explain them to me.’

“The confused girl reappears in various guises as an adult, still trying to understand how the world really works. In ‘The Face-Lift,’ she’s the staid former roommate of a fabulously rich, spoiled woman from San Salvador who has flouted almost every rule, yet remains for the narrator a wild alter ego to be admired and forgiven her many trespasses. Similarly, in ‘Choosing Sides,’ an American woman, caught up in her son’s troubles and at odds with her husband, finds succor from a free-thinking friend in France, a woman she calls <em>la jumelle</em>—her twin.

“Several of the stories are set in France, in this book a land where the emotions that must be restrained at home can be indulged. ‘Pilgrimage’ is one of the Paris stories and easily the book’s most humorous. Here a woman falls head over heels but not for a man. It’s a shop that infatuates her, and like most enchantments, it ends with a rude awakening.

“Funny in a sardonic, sad way is ‘Assistance,’ in which the grown daughter of an elderly couple almost crippled by their crotchety ways becomes exasperatingly tangled in their rapidly devolving life.

“Several stories are marred by their too-neat endings, didactic summings-up that offer moral lessons an astute reader already understands. But others are subtler and all the more powerful for it. ‘At the Beach’ explores, from a husband’s point of view, the sheer awfulness of a quarrel that almost derails a marriage. It is written with impressive economy.

“The most haunting of all is ‘The Treatment,’ a tale of a woman who must infuse herself daily with an antibiotic to combat a long-standing illness. The description of the process—a sort of holy medicinal sacrament that the woman believes means salvation—is stunningly written and vividly sensual. But Robinson takes it further, introducing a visiting nurse who is, if not quite the angel of death, then certainly an angel of disillusionment who makes no attempt to comfort the afflicted.

“<em>A Perfect Stranger</em> is a strong collection from a writer who knows that within each adult forever resides that bewildered child, still seeking to understand what the grown-ups are talking about, still making his or her way in an eternally foreign land."
