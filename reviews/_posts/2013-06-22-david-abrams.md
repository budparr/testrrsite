"Just as Robinson did in her previous novels <em>Cost</em> and <em>Sweetwater</em>, <em>Sparta</em> is unapologetic in the way it gets its point across: we must always remember the human cost of the decision to enter war. No matter where you fall in the spectrum between hawk and dove, Robinson's novel is powerfully affecting and takes its place on the shelf of essential war literature."
