*Summer Light* is the story of a young woman hovering between careers, between marriages, between lives—and of the summer that throws her off balance and onto her feet. Laura is in her middle 30s, separated but not yet divorced from her philandering husband. She is spending the summer on the Maine coast with Ward, the man she lives with; Sam, her 3-year-old son; her sister, Sarah; Sarah’s husband, Richie; and their two adolescent daughters. It was supposed to be a tranquil family summer, full of berry picking, sailing, days spent in the sun and evenings before the fire—but it doesn’t turn out quite that way.
