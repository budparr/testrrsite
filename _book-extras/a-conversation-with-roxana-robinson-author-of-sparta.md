**Why did you choose the title Sparta?**

Sparta was an ancient Greek city-state that dedicated itself entirely to war. It producedwarriors famous for their strength, skill and bravery, as well as for their moral codebased on honor, discipline and loyalty. When I was doing research for this book, I wasfascinated to learn about the affinity that Marines feel for Sparta. They identify with theSpartan warriors, and see their code as a kind of military ideal. They use Sparta and itsheroic values as a kind of touchstone, and view themselves as the spiritual descendantsof the Spartans.

I was also interested in the two cultures themselves. In Sparta, everything else  family,commerce, education  was subordinated to the business of war. In the Marine Corps,too, this is true, though the USMC exists alongside the civilian world. I wondered whateffect this had had on Sparta, over time. I wondered how the tension between civilianand military values would be reflected in the Marine culture. Im interested in the momentat which systems break down.

In 2005 a massacre took place in Haditha, a town in northwestern Iraq. Twenty-fourunarmed Iraqi civilians, including several children and an old man in a wheelchair, weregunned down by a group of Marines, in circumstances never satisfactorily explained.The Marines were based in a combat outpost they had named Sparta. The nameresonated for me, echoing with the ways in which war and honor and a sense ofhumanity can collide. So I gave my novel this title wanting to make the connectionbetween _Sparta_ and the Marines very clear and explicit.

**How is fiction valuable in exploring a subject such as vets returninghome?**

I think fiction can create a kind of narrative that can reach us inside, in places that nonfiction doesnt go. I once asked a historian what he thought was the best source to usein order to understand a particular historical period. Novels, he said at once. Theygive you the best sense of whats really going on. Fiction allows us to explore thingson a visceral and emotional level as well as an intellectual one. When I started writing_Sparta_, I had read the facts and figures, Id read the political theory. I wanted somethingthat allowed me to learn what it felt like to be in this situation, to know what it was like toinhabit one persons mind and feelings, to learn what this was like for him. Only in fictionare you allowed to create this deep and continuing connection, as a writer, and as areader, only in fiction are you allowed to feel it.

**Was it difficult for you to get into the mind of a returned Marine?Have you written from a male perspective before?**

It was difficult. I have written from a male perspective but Conrad was very differentfrom me for many different reasons. Im not only a woman but Im Quaker, and from adifferent generation. And the whole military culture is deeply, deeply male. So I had toabandon many of the ideas and responses most familiar to me before I could enter intoConrads mind and world. It was hugely challenging, and very exhilarating. One of thebest things about fiction is that it allows you to live lives very different from your own.

**What sort of research did you do?**

Every kind I could think of. I read and read and read: war memoirs, articles, testimoniesand military books. I read the Marine Officers Handbook, and learned about MOUT(Military Operations in Urban Terrain) warfare, and how to clear a room and what therules were about moustaches. I watched Marine videos on YouTube, and saw themdancing and swearing and shooting in the dusty streets and eating MREs in their rooms.

I became a huge fan of the Marines, and when a Marine friend offered to take me toQuantico I was nearly speechless with awe and excitement: that was the inner sanctum.I interviewed veterans. I talked to anyone who would talk to me. Most people weregenerous and helpful. They welcomed me into their houses, and told me their stories:how theyd come to enlist, and what their families thought, and then what theyd doneand what theyd seen in country. They told me those things that will stay with them therest of their lives. They showed me pictures, and described how it felt, coming home,and why they couldnt talk to their parents or girlfriends, and why it was so hard anddisorienting to go to a wedding reception, where all your friends were laughing anddancing, and how it felt to try to live in both worlds. And they laughed, rememberingthings, and then they turned sober, remembering others, and then their voices droppedand broke, and they couldnt go on, and they were the ones who taught me what it waslike. They gave me Conrads story.

**What surprised you during the course of writing the book?**

Many things surprised me. The first thing was how difficult it was to gain entry into themilitary world. Im a woman and a novelist, so I had no credentials. I went into a groupof arriving vets at an airport once, and asked to talk to a few of them. People wouldpause when I said I was a writer, but when they heard I was a novelist, not a journalist,theyd walk away. A Marine friend explained that the military is tribal. Hes right: its atightly insular clan, bound together by beliefs and goals and duties that are specific tothem, and unrelated to those of outsiders. This insularity means that the rest of us aremade to feel like just that  outsiders. I once went to a Marine recruiting center, just toget a sense of what it was like there. The officers were young, handsome and absolutelyimplacable. They nearly swept me out of the room with a broom. I dont think Ive everbeen so robustly rebuffed, just for being who I am: wrong gender, wrong generation,wrong occupation.

Another disconcerting surprise occurred when I interviewed a medic whod beenstationed in Iraq. Every day he had to try to repair the broken bodies that were broughtto him, young men broken and wounded, damaged irrevocably. He told me about seeingthe news, on a bulletin board, that Bush had been re-elected, and about the rage thatwent through him at the sight. The medic was still raging when I talked to him, andI suddenly realized as he talked that I was included as a target of his anger: I was acivilian, and we had allowed this to continue. It was the first  and only  time I everfelt physical fear while I was conducting an interview, and it taught me to respect thegreat and powerful forces I was dealing with. I have never ever been in the presence ofsomeone who was so angry.

So the other great surprise was this: I had thought that war was about strategy andmechanics, weapons and planning. But I learned that it was about emotion.

**Were there particular moments that illuminated the intersectionbetween the veteran life and the civilian?**

One vet, a captain, agreed to meet with me. He named a time, and a restaurant nearwhere he lived. I was four hours away, and spent the day on the highways. When Iarrived at the cafe, I found not only the captain there, but also his wife and six-yearold daughter. I was surprised to see them, but we all had a pleasant dinner andconversation. After the meal the wife and daughter left, and the captain and I sat outsideand talked until midnight. It was then that he explained that his wife and daughter hadbeen there to see what I was like  in case I was someone he wouldnt want to talk to.They were there to protect him, they were Security. This was a man whod fought inBaghdad. Every time I think of them  his beautiful, intelligent wife and his lively, brightdaughter, dancing around our table  coming there to watch over him, it catches at my heart. Its one of the reasons I wrote the book  the deep inarticulated gulf between ourcivilian experience and theirs. The fact that wives and children need to watch over thesemen.

**Did soldiers talk to you about their experiences with PTSD?**

One story I will never forget came from a man from Texas told me about his time inIraq. He was in a combat zone and on a particular date, he said  he gave the date -something happened that he will never tell to anybody. Later, when he came back home,he had the headaches, insomnia, flashbacks, panic attacks, inability to concentrate andthe rest of the crazy quilt that makes up the symptoms of PTSD. The VA prescribed onemedication after another for him until he was up to thirteen. But he still couldnt keep ajob, and he didnt see how he could make a life. Then he was given a trained servicedog named Paddy. I was talking with him by phone, and he asked me if I was goingto come down to Texas. When I said no, he said he was sorry, because it meant hecouldnt introduce me to Paddy. Paddy is now with him all the time, and perfectly attunedto him. When the vet gets a panic attack, Paddy knows it, and immediately takes mesomewhere safe. And where is that? I asked. The truck, usually, he said. We waitthere until I can go back. But the best thing Paddy does happens at night. I couldntsleep, he said, because when I did I had these nightmares that were so frighteningthat I couldnt endure them. Every night, Id wake up screaming and crying, until I wastoo scared to go to sleep, even with the pills. Sleep was terror. He paused. But now Ihave Paddy. He sleeps in bed with me, Im not ashamed to tell you that. Now I can riskgoing to sleep because if I start to have a dream, Paddy knows it and he licks my faceand wakes me up, and he goes on licking my face until Im calm. He doesnt care if Imafraid. And so now Im not afraid to go to sleep because he makes me feel safe. He hasa job, now, and hes down to only three medications.

**What made you set Conrads home in Westchester?**

Conrad lives in a middle-class, educated, suburban community in the northeast. I hadlearned, to my surprise, that many of the new members of the volunteer armed forcesdont come from the south, or from military families, or from blue-collar backgrounds, allof which were traditional sources for the military. Instead, they came from middle-classliberal families in the northeast. I thought that was really interesting: we were seeinga surprising cultural shift. So I gave Conrad a community that would reflect the newdemographics, and show some of the cultural discomfort that the shift created: his familyhas no idea why he would do this. And now Im hearing from family after family who tellme this is what happened to them, and that they were completely confounded by theirson or daughter, taking a new path.

**What initially inspired you to write about a US Marine returning homefrom Iraq?**

One day  maybe seven years ago  I read an article in _The New York Times_ about ourtroops in Iraq. They were being sent out in unarmored Humvees on patrol, and beingblown up by roadside bombs. These bombs (IEDs, or Improvised Explosive Devices)were widespread, and they had devastating results. Traumatic Brain Injuries wereincreasingly common, but the military was reluctant to diagnose them because of thecost of treatment and because the acknowledgment would mean the loss of combatants.I was appalled reading this. In any war you expect the troops to suffer hardships, but youexpect those hardships to result from the enemy or the terrain, not from lack of supportby the soldiers own country. I was appalled that the greatest military power in the worldwas sending its troops into danger, unprotected, with outdated gear, and then refusingto acknowledge the consequences. If we had to fight a war, (and it wasnt clear to methat we did), then at least we should provide our troops with the best possible equipmentand support. We were not doing that. We could afford to spend billions of dollars onstealth bombers, but we couldnt afford to buy armored vehicles for our troops to driveon roads studded with bombs. After reading that article, I couldnt stop thinking of them,these brave young men, going out day after day, loyal, brave, obedient, waiting for theexplosion.

The article changed the way I thought about our troops. I started thinking about them aspeople needing our protection. And I started thinking about the effects of the war  on thepeople who engineered it, the people who fought it, and on the people at home. I comefrom a long line of activists, so you could say its in my genes  Harriet Beecher Stowe ismy great-great-great aunt. Im always interested by moral consequences, I write aboutthem quite a lot.

_Is *Sparta_ an indictment of American foreign policy?*

Not really. But its an examination of the consequences of our policy in this war, and toa certain extent of all wars. All wars have devastating and unintended consequences,which must be weighed by those in charge of policy against the necessity for militaryaction. This war was responsible for thousands of American deaths and hundreds ofthousands of non-Americans. It was also, because of new techniques and strategies,responsible for a new and devastating kind of psychological trauma. We have startedtraining our troops to kill more easily and more readily than ever before. This makesus effective in the field, but no one knows the cost to the troops who come home andhave to live with the memories of what theyve done. So _Sparta_ is really examining theconsequences of this war, and asking the question: how much is war worth to us? Canwe tolerate these consequences?
