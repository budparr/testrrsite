An Evening with Roxana Robinson and Linda M. Grasso: Two expert authors discuss O’Keeffe’s coming of age in modernist America and her identity as an independent artist and trailblazing feminist. These presentations followed by lively conversation will examine O’Keeffe’s intense personal relationships, explore how the struggle to balance love and work fueled her extraordinary accomplishments, and situate her in the women’s movements that affected the creation and reception of her art over several generations.
