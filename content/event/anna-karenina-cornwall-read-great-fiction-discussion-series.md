Author and Cornwall resident Roxana Robinson will lead a discussion of Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, for 9 weeks beginning Tuesday, January 12, at 4 pm through March 9. Each week, through Zoom meetings, Roxana will read a short excerpt from the book, and then lead a discussion of the week’s reading.

Roxana Robinson is the author of 9 books of fiction and the biography of Georgia O'Keeffe. She received fellowships from the NEA and the Guggenheim Foundation. She teaches Anna Karenina in the MFA Program at Hunter College in New York City, and as she says, “I know it well and love it.” Participants should plan to read 100 pages a week. She'll be using the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation.

The book can be ordered from local bookstores like House of Books in Kent or Oblong Books in Millerton.

Class is open to all and is free but donations are encouraged and welcomed.

Registration is required for this Zoom series.
