How do peace activists stay in the fight? The antiwar movement today is demoralized and directionless, and the entire planet seems to be sleepwalking towards disaster. Our panelists include writers, journalists and organizers who have kept their spirits up in the face of apathy, derision and misunderstanding. What have they learned about the human and psychological side of our worldâ€™s addiction to war? How can activists dig deeper into the heart of the most brutal problem our planet has ever known? What will we find there? This panel aims to stir up new ideas and new avenues for hope, cooperation and agitation for change.
