Join us for a conversation with Roxana Robinson, author of _Georgia O’Keeffe: A Life_, which was first published in 1989. 30 years later, the updated expanded edition features a new preface by Robinson setting O’Keeffe in artistic context, and never before published letters between O’Keeffe and Arthur Macmahon from 1915 – 1938. Robinson will be in conversation with Nancy Scott, professor of fine arts at Brandeis University and an O’Keeffe scholar.

This discussion will take place via the video conferencing app – ZOOM. Details for accessing the Zoom lecture will be with your receipt upon registering and again sent via email the day before the event. Please register in advance in order to access the program.

Note that all program times are in MST.
