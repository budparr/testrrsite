Join us for a conversation with Roxana Robinson, author of _Georgia O’Keeffe: A Life_, which was first published in 1989. 30 years later, the updated expanded edition features a new preface by Robinson setting O’Keeffe in artistic context, and never before published letters between O’Keeffe and Arthur Macmahon from 1915 – 1938. 

Friday, November 13TH | 3:00 PM - 4:15 PM MST
