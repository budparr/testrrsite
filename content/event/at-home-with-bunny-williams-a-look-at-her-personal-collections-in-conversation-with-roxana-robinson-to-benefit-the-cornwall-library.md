The Cornwall Library is delighted to announce a benefit event at the home of our neighbors, legendary Interior designer [Bunny Williams](https://bunnywilliams.com/), and her husband, antiques dealer [John Rosselli](https://www.johnrosselli.com/). Ms. Williams will discuss some favorite pieces from their personal collection with their friend, author and professor Roxana Robinson. The event will be held on Zoom but will be live from Ms. Williams and Mr. Rosselli’s home in Falls Village.

What makes this event different from others that Bunny has done is that it will give the audience the chance to come inside the house themselves - through Roxana and her personalized descriptions. She will be narrating the tour - what it’s like to come in through the kitchen door of this house made famous in Bunny's widely adored book "An Affair with a House." Attendees will be made to feel like they've been invited to tea with a friend.

A much admired figure in the design world, Bunny Williams founded her own firm in 1988, after twenty-two years at the esteemed decorating firm Parrish Hadley. She is a much sought-after consultant for design and decor by distinguished clients worldwide and is beloved by legions of fans who extend far beyond the design world.

Her New York City design office is complemented by a nearby showroom for the [Bunny Williams Home](https://www.bunnywilliamshome.com/) line, a collection of furniture, lighting, and accessories bearing her name, and by 100 Main, her shop in downtown Falls Village. She has written seven books, among them “An Affair with a House” about her love of the house where she and her husband and their beloved dogs reside in Falls Village. Her generous support of the local region is shown not only by her shop, which specializes in work by regional artists and artisans, but also by the wildly popular event she co-founded called Trade Secrets, Rare Plant and Garden Antique show, benefitting Women’s Support Services in Sharon, CT.

[Roxana Robinson](https://www.roxanarobinson.com/) is a celebrated author and Cornwall resident. She teaches literature in the Creative Writing Program in the MFA program at Hunter College in New York City and is the author of ten books – six novels, three story collections and the biography of Georgia O’Keeffe. Her work has appeared in _The New Yorker_, _The Atlantic, The New York Times,_ _Best American Short Stories_ and elsewhere. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, an NEA Fellowship, and the Barnes & Noble Writers for Writers Award, among others, and she is a former president of the Authors Guild.
