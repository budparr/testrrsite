We invite you to join Professor Roxana Robinson as we celebrate the new, expanded edition of her 1989 biography, _Georgia O'Keeffe: The Life of an American Artist_, which has been praised as, "The Best book ever written on O'Keeffe...An invaluable resource." In conversation with Dawn Tripp, bestselling author of _Georgia,_ the historical novel based on O'Keeffe's life. What new insights into the life of O'Keeffe have the last thirty years revealed? How has interest in O'Keeffe continued to grow? As both artist and subject, how do we place O'Keeffe and her enduring influence over American art and culture? Robinson and Tripp will discuss these questions and dive into the rich and intense personal life of an American artist who has captivated generations.
