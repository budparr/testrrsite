The energy here, and the drama of the book, is all about the tension of inhabiting a damaged mind as it attempts to right itself, through discipline, through rage, through alcohol, through family, and through therapy. The ups and downs of that long and harrowing journey home make *Sparta* a riveting and important contribution to the literature of the Iraq War and to anti-war literature in general.
