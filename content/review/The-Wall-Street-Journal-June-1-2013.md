"[A] powerful reminder both of [post-traumatic stress disorder’s] concrete existence and of the risk it poses to veterans of America’s 21st-century wars...Robinson...is unsparingly forensic in her account of this proud ex-soldier’s tortured inability to readjust to civilian life...[*Sparta*’s] force lies in its level of bared psychological detail. Without becoming strident or pushy, it sounds an alarm for an invisible American crisis."
