"*Cost* is stunning. Each of the characters is so perfectly realized, each is made known to us with such heart and intelligence. This is a very big  book: the territory of family is more fragile and dangerous than any geography weknow, and Roxana Robinson has made life of that. I loved, admired, and was frankly undone by every minute of it."
