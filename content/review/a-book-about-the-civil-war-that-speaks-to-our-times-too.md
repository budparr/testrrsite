title: A Book About the Civil War that Speaks to Our Times Too
attribution: '"Using far-flung sources and excruciating care, she creates the map;
  her novelist’s skills render it in 3-D. Few Americans may have an ancestry as acutely
  divergent across the Mason-Dixon Line as Robinson has, but the legacy of slavery
  and the Civil War is still being felt by our nation. “Dawson’s Fall” is a richly
  envisioned attempt to reconcile with that troubled history."'
