The Writer's Hotel is a hybrid writers conference that meets each June at a floating campus between three hotels in Midtown Manhattan. TWH is unique. We work with each writer on their writing, for months before our conference. On site in NYC in June, writers attend large and small workshops, agent pitch meetings, editor lectures and genre labs.
