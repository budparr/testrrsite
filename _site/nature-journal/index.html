<p>The phoebes have been nesting here for as long as I can remember. My father used to complain about them, though my mother defended them. He thought they were messy, and they are a bit. But they are indefatigable gnatcatchers, and they are cheerful, sociable birds. My mother liked them, and they have always been here. They build a nest on the porch, on top of the molding over the doorway, on the far edge, in the most remote corner of the porch. The nest is modest, made of mud and twigs, mostly, but they finish it, beautifully, with a coverlet of fine moss.</p>

<p>Now the female is brooding her eggs. When I come out on the porch I see her there, from the corner of my eye. I don&#8217;t look at her directly, I don&#8217;t want to alarm her. Her soft greys melt into the shadowy reaches of the dark porch wall. She sits motionless and brave, nestled deep into her refuge, alert, her bright dark eye watching. Outside, her mate perches on a branch of the ash tree, repeating his name. &#8220;Fee-bee,&#8221; he says, over and over, &#8220;Fee-bee.&#8221; But she says nothing. She sits still and silent, the eggs beneath her heavy and full, gravid with life.</p>

<p>It was my grandfather, “Lawyer Sam” Scoville, who got us all watching birds. Besides lawyering, Sam was a writer and an amateur naturalist. He died when I was five, but by then the whole family was hooked. I read all his books: “Man and Beast,” “Lords of the Wild,” “The Out-of-Doors Club” and the rest. I grew up watching not only birds, but animals and snakes – everything in the whole big natural shebang.</p>

<p>Five years ago, we took over the house that Sam built in Cornwall. One afternoon, watching the orange flash of a Baltimore Oriole high in our oak, it occurred to me that the bird’s family might have been watched by my own for many generations. It gave me an odd feeling. Of course I don’t think my grandfather had anything to do with it, but I was pretty sure that, if Sam were around, he’d be delighted to see me watching.</p>

<p>This Christmas I gave my six-year-old grandson a pair of binoculars and a children’s bird book. On Christmas morning we sat in the window overlooking the lake, leafing through the pages. He was keen, but I warned him that we might not see anything interesting at first. I was a little worried: beginners want showy, exciting birds, but what’s usually around are crows and sparrows.</p>

<p>I heard a quiet, steady tapping, and I looked outside. Ten feet away was a big black and white bird, clinging to the trunk of the ash tree, drumming his way towards dinner.</p>

<p>“Oh. My. Gosh,” I said. “That’s a pileated woodpecker!”</p>

<p>My grandson looked outside, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>The spectacular pileated is our largest native woodpecker, (except for the Ivory-Billed, which may or may not still be extant, somewhere deep in the southern forests). But the pileated is very extant up here.</p>

<p>“Pileated” means “crested,” and his crest is scarlet, with a zany point on the end like a jester’s. His bold black and white plumage is patterned like Venetian livery. He has a long  serpentine neck and a powerful bill. He eats boring insects &#8211; ants and grubs. You’ve seen the gigantic holes he makes, drilling for carpenter ant, but don’t blame him for damaging the tree: ants have already hollowed it out.</p>

<p>He nests in holes in trees himself. (Though once a pair of pileateds took over my bluebird box. They enlarged the entrance, but no matter how large it was they still couldn’t fit inside. They were like giants trying to sit at a kindergarten table.)</p>

<p>Like most woodpeckers, the pileated is shy. I know they’re around, but I rarely see one. So on Christmas morning I was thrilled to see it &#8211; scarlet cockade, Venetian livery, all of it.</p>

<p>“Okay,” I whispered, “This is your first ten minutes of birdwatching, and you’re seeing one of the great American birds. This is almost a miracle.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” my grandson whispered.</p>

<p>Of course I don’t think my grandfather had anything to do with this, but it was funny, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>If you drive up Town Street from the Lake, just before you reach Scoville Road you enter dangerous territory. The Scoville farm house stands on the right, and across from it, in a field on the left, stands the duckpond. The traffic between the house and the duckpond is serious. I don’t know if you’ve ever had to stop your car for the goose parade, but I have. There is no way through.</p>

<p>The geese belong to Thalia Scoville, widow of my cousin Ralph. Thalia has lived in that house for decades; she can’t remember when she first got the geese. They’re not exactly pets, they don’t have names. But they aren’t used for eating, either – too much grease, says Thalia, and too tough. The eggs aren’t taken, either. “They lay them in such big clutches you never know which egg is fresh,” she says. Really, the geese are kept for parades.</p>

<p>Thalia’s geese are tall and handsome, brownish grey with darker trim. Their long necks, erect carriage and heavy bodies mark them as domestic; their coloring suggests descent from the European greylag. (This was the goose made famous by its decision to call Konrad Lorenz “mom.”) They move slowly. I won’t use the undignified word “waddle,” because they are nothing if not dignified, but they shift from side to side as they walk.</p>

<p>There are about fifteen of them now. On a hot day they cluster, squatting comfortably in the dusty barnyard, or on the lawn, under a tree. Some sit, some stand. One of them may balance on one foot, doing goose yoga. They’re relaxed, until, mysteriously, the moment arrives. The geese look around jerkily, giving little bugling trills. They stand and gather, then, honking companionably, they begin the parade, as though an inaudible whistle were blown. Down the driveway they go. The ducks and guineaufowl follow, caught up by the excitement. The honking is  muted and melodious, like jazz musicians, jamming on oboes.</p>

<p>At the road the geese walk single file. Bobbing heads held high, yellow webbed feet turned in, they march majestically across Town Street. Traffic comes to a halt. Once a police car arrived, during the march. The policeman honked. The geese honked back. He turned on his circling light. The geese ignored him. He turned on his siren. The geese maintained a flawless goose-step. Their mission was to reach the other side of the road, not to get caught up in altercations about right of way.</p>

<p>On the far side they scramble up the bank, surprisingly awkward. A wing or two flaps out, for balance.</p>

<p>The pond is calm and empty. By now the ducks have also gained  the far side, guineafowl scuttling behind them. One by one the geese cross the grass to the pond. With a heavy fluttering rush they launch themselves into the water. Suddenly graceful, they float, their long necks erect, their snobbish heads aloft. They look down at us over their yellow bills, like dowagers looking over their lorgnettes.</p>

<p>They have arrived. They are superior. They’ve accomplished their mission. And we are allowed to drive on up the road.</p>

<p>A few nights ago, around midnight, we heard something that reminded me of one of the Random Acts of Culture. Maybe you saw the YouTube film of Macy’s department store in Philadelphia, suddenly transformed by anonymous singers who were performing the Messiah. This was a little like that: suddenly, through the cold, silent night, we heard singers, two bright voices, harmonizing in an exquisite and nerve-wracking duet. Their song was eerie and haunting, lunar in its cold loveliness. The night was transformed.</p>

<p>Coyotes, of course. Cornwall has an active resident population. My cousin Fred Scoville told me that a pack of them took eleven of Thalia’s geese in one night. Which sounds like a good-sized pack, though it was probably only one pair of parents and their pups. Connecticut coyotes hunt in packs only until the pups are grown, and then disperse.  Coyotes are monogamous, and the main social unit is the mating pair.</p>

<p>The coyote (<em>canis latrans)</em> is a medium-sized member of the Canidae family. Originally from the western plains, they’ve moved east, breeding with big Canadian wolves, so our Connecticut coyotes are slightly larger than their western cousins. They’re beautiful animals, with luxurious bushy coats, slender pointed noses and long prick ears. They’ll  breed with dogs, though coy-dogs are rare. (Mixed offspring rarely survive, since pups need both parents for support. Also, like mules, coydogs are often infertile.) Coyotes are opportunistic, and will eat almost anything, which is why they’re so successful as a species. They’ll eat garbage, insects, mice, rabbits, small deer &#8211; even small pets, I’m sorry to report.</p>

<p>And they’re singers: they have at least ten different variants of vocal sounds, including growls, woofs, barks, howls and yelps. Woofs and growls are short-distance threats, barks and bark-howls are used in greeting, lone and group howls provide location information during separation, and a group yip-howl occurs after a reunion.</p>

<p>The song we heard the other night was clear, passionate and very potent. At first I thought they were hunting. I’ve heard them sometimes in full cry, voice after voice declaring itself, yodeling up to the top of the scale, then drifting into strange, four-part harmony. But this was different: discrete, full of sudden energy, rising at once to full pitch, and then, just as suddenly, stopping.</p>

<p>Coyotes breed once a year. In Connecticut, this happens between January and March. The female is only in estrus for 4 to 15 days, so there’s a small window of opportunity. According to my book, there’s one other occasion on which coyotes vocalise: before copulation, the pair may sing a duet.<br>
I don’t want to start rumors, but I think last week our local  coyotes had a date night.</p>

<p>Recently, in a fit of worldiness, I had the car washed.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why I did this. It goes against my Puritan grain, and besides, it means rain within twenty-four hours. Still, I did it, and at home, I parked in the driveway, feeling satisfied. The black car looked gleaming and handsome against the autumnal landscape.</p>

<p>The next morning, from inside the house, I heard a series of drumming thrums outside. I listened, puzzled: they were loud bellicose thuds, syncopated and irregular. I looked out the window: the polished black car was under attack.</p>

<p>Our land is owned by a flock of six big wild turkeys who stalk back and forth across it at all hours. They move in lordly fashion, pausing to peck up tidbits from the lawn, the driveway, the rocks. The flock is all toms, and I think of them as rejects from a group of adults, rebellious adolescents who were kicked out. It’s easy to see why: they have poor social skills. They’re big and awkward and foolish-looking, with their gawky carriage, their slow, jerky walks. They are deeply disdainful of us, and when they see us they jerk their necks in outrage, trading exasperated comments. There they are again, they say to each other. What are they doing here?</p>

<p>That day, when I looked outside, the flock was spread out raggedly across the hillside. They were walking that weird turkey walk – head low, body crouching and gliding, long neck jerking spasmodically.</p>

<p>But one of the toms had stopped on the driveway: he’d seen an enemy. Passing alongside the polished black car, he’d suddenly spied another turkey walking right beside him. When he stopped and turned, the other tom did too. When he raised his head and lengthened his neck in a threatening manner, the other tom did too. When he swelled himself up, puffing his feathers, weaving his head and leaning forward, the other tom did exactly the same thing. It was an outrage: a complete newcomer, challenging this big tom on his own territory. The tom darted his head out and struck hard. Bam! Bam-bam! Bam! Bam!</p>

<p>The other tom did just the same, hitting our tom bang on his own beak. It was uncanny, how perfectly coordinated they were, how precisely one tom mimicked the other. It was like the famous scene in Duck Soup. The two toms seemed magically joined at the cerebral cortex.</p>

<p>When I couldn’t stand it anymore I went down and opened the front door.</p>

<p>“You idiot!” I shouted. “That’s you! You’re attacking yourself!”</p>

<p>The tom gave himself one more warning look and turned back to me.</p>

<p>There she is again, he muttered. What’s she doing here? He hunched over crossly and began stalking up the hill in a threatening way, headed for the woods, talking under his breath.</p>

<p>My car still has the dents from the fight, a little battered ring near the fuel cap. It will be awhile before I get it washed again.</p>

<p>My mother, who turned 100 last summer, has been coming to Cornwall all her life. She says the biggest difference is the return of the forests. “When I was a child it was all open land,” she says. “All farms.”</p>

<p>Most of the Northeast was farmland until the railways opened up the great midwestern grain fields, in the mid-nineteenth century, and, after that, big agriculture slowly moved west. Cornwall farms lasted longer than most, but here, too, in the last half-century, open pastureland has reverted to woods and brush. Which is not good habitat for cows, but it’s great for mountain lions. The lions were here long before we arrived, but around a hundred years ago they were hunted out, the species extirpated, and the  habitat destroyed for pasture.</p>

<p>Now the habitat is coming back, and it seems the lion is too.</p>

<p>It’s a fabulous animal: our native Mountain Lion is the fourth largest cat in the world. He has more than 40 names: cougar, and puma, and panther, catamount and painter and mountain screamer. (His scream is something you never want to hear.) He’s big, around 120 pounds and 8 feet long, and he’s beautiful, lean and supple, with a tawny pelt and a level green stare. He’s powerful: no other species preys on the mountain lion, and it takes a whole pack of wolves to overcome him. He’s shy, elusive and solitary, with crepuscular habits. His primary prey is deer, though he’ll eat rodents. He’s rarely aggressive to humans.</p>

<p>But is he here in Cornwall? Last year the DEP declared the Eastern Mountain Lion officially extinct. However, this doesn’t include the Western Mountain, a close cousin who has officially appeared in Connecticut. The lion killed last summer, on a highway near Greenwich, was a Western, from North Dakota. Mountain lions are fabled roamers, and the Western lions seem to be reclaiming the east.  I asked the Fish and Wildlife Department about this. “Why wouldn’t mountain lions be back? All the other big predators are back in the northeast – black bears, bobcats, coyotes,” they said. “It makes sense for the lions to be back.”</p>

<p>Certainly Cornwall has the others. And we’ve had a lot of mountain lion sightings. My friend Jane saw one on Cream Hill Road. My friend Julia saw one, carrying a cub in her mouth. And my cousin Martha, sitting on her glassed-in-porch one evening, watched a mountain lion slide quietly along the outside of it, two feet away. It was stalking something, maybe a field mouse.</p>

<p>I’m kind of jealous of the sightings. I’d love to see our lion.</p>

<p>It’s a gorgeous notion, that if we loosen our grip on the landscape it will revert, sliding silently back into its own deep current, filling up again with the beautiful wild creatures that walked so lightly on it once. My mother would like this.</p>

<p>My garden is divided into two countries, north and south. They’re separated by the mason line, a stone walkway.</p>

<p>In the north, the garden rises sedately toward the woods, interspersed by stretches of stone  ledge.  It’s a quiet space. The plants are harmonious, the colors subdued &#8211; white, pale rose, mauve: lambs’ ears, a pale pink anemone, the white cloud of calamintha. The floating spires of cimicifuga, misty-topped artemisia. The boldest color is the deep purple of heliotrope, the most dramatic shape the towering nicotiana sylvestris. The stone steps are threaded with creeping thyme. It’s a pretty New England garden; Sissinghurst is clearly an ancestor.</p>

<p>In the south, everything is different. Just past the stone walk the ground drops steeply into a rough ravine, a  dry watercourse running through it. At the end of the ravine is a rustic wooden bridge;  beyond that, the meadow.  This garden is not well-bred or decorous: the reverse. Native blue lobelias have colonised it, thrusting their bright, bold spires everywhere – among the ostrich ferns and Russian sage and valerian. This harsh lobelia blue is actually the mildest color down here in the south: I’ve let in the cardinal flower, the native red lobelia, with its six-foot spires of  dense, saturated red.  “A bit showy,” one of my gardening friends said tactfully. She’s wrong: it’s not a bit showy, it’s completely over the top, and it’s spreading fast, popping up wherever the blue has not. That’s not all. Another gardening friend handed me two small potted annuals last spring. “You can put them anywhere,” she said. “They’re Mexican sunflowers, bright orange, about six feet tall.” In the north they’d look shockingly out of place, but down here in the south, with all those pushy lobelias, they strike a triumphant chord. My Mexican sunflower friend also gave me two vines, which I planted at either end of the bridge: now scarlet-orange blooms  clamber along the railings. Red salvia makes a fine scarlet mist, threading along the banks . On either side of the bridge is the tall elegant native milkweed, asclepia incarnata, whose soft pink flower strikes a muted counter-tone to all the brassy hot notes. Creamy clethra blossoms makes thick swathes through the rioting parade.</p>

<p>The point of all this is the visitors: lots of these bright-hued plants are native, which makes the southern garden a destination, a flight hub. Butterflies flutter through all day: on the milkweed are clouds of amber-colored monarchs, yellow tiger-swallowtails, russet great spangled fritillaries and iridescent pipe-vine swallowtails. The butterflies hover absent-mindedly, then alight. They breathe with their wings, inhaling, exhaling, lifting dreamily off. Zillions of bees,  focused and serious, climb in and out of the clethra. Cadres of hummingbirds, those tiny avian helicopters, swoop up and down the  cardinal flower spires. Fat striped monarch caterpillars march lumpily along the bridge, on their way somewhere else.  It’s a thriving community.</p>

<p>The northern garden &#8211; so decorous, so pretty, so polite! &#8211; has bees among the calamintha, not much more. Everyone else has gone to Margaritaville.</p>

<p>August 19, 2009. Maine.</p>

<p>Last night, around midnight, our lights were out, but I wasn&#8217;t asleep.<br>
The night was very quiet, there was no wind. So when I heard something outside on the deck it was very distinct. It was some kind of movement, soft but large. Not an insect, banging against the screen, something else. It sounded like something brushing against the shingles. I sat up, listening, and when I heard it again I got up and moved quietly across the room. I leaned down into the open window that overlooked the deck and switched on the outside light.</p>

<p>On the deck were two raccoons, one large, one small, both of them staring at me through their dark masks, like two robbers caught at the teller&#8217;s window at the bank.</p>

<p>The mother was on her hind legs, her front paws neatly crooked in front of her, like a housewife&#8217;s over her midriff. Her dark fur was full and bushy, standing out around her like a luxuriant halo. Her belly was pale, and her face and ears and paws were very dark. She stood up as tall as she could get, watching me. She craned her neck, moving her head very slightly from side to side. She gave a quiet, open-mouthed hiss: &#8220;Hahh.&#8221; It was a small, precise sound. It was meant in defense, but it was not frightening. It seemed more like the chanting of a spell, like some kind of rune or wild magic. Standing upright, the mother looked like a strange, small, beautiful person, with her delicate curled hands, her elegant masked face, her graceful shifting movement.</p>

<p>The cub had slid sideways, moving underneath the bench on the outer edge of the deck. From there he peered out at me, his round innocent eyes shining in the light. The mother stood still, weaving slightly from side to side, like a Javanese dancer. We stared at each other and then she gave another quiet &#8220;Hahh,&#8221; another small piece of raccoon magic. Then she dropped onto all fours and rumbled over to the bench, where she slid underneath it, next to the cub. Then the two of them moved like dark ripples over the edge of the deck, their thick cloudy fur lit up by the overhead light. They moved quickly but noiselessly, in that digressive, indirect gait that raccoons have, a sort of purposeful but mystifying amble. They pattered up the mossy ledge and up into the trees, and after that they were lost in the darkness.<br>

<p>The trail around Witch Hole Pond swoops mildly up and down, along the pond, through the woods. I was on skis, making my way slowly up a little wooded rise. The wind had dropped, and deep snow lay everywhere, on the pond, the trees, the carriage road, muffling all sound. There was only the faint hiss beneath my skis. And something else: a modest tapping.</p>

<p>I looked up into the trees. At this time of year there isn&#8217;t much motion or color in the woods, besides the snowy branches moving in the wind, the deep cerulean sky beyond. </p>

<p>So he was pretty obvious, despite his discretion. The pileated woodpecker is a huge bird, nearly two feet long, with spectacular plumage. He&#8217;s mostly dull black, but he has bold white stripes down his neck, and a showy black stripe along his cheek. An absurdly long chisel-shaped beak: he looks like a bird drawn by a child. On top of his head is a flaming scarlet crest, high and sharply pointed, like a medieval jester&#8217;s hat. And there is something slightly foolish about him: he&#8217;s a bit gawky, clambering jerkily around the trunk of a tree, fluttering away furtively if you get too close. Pileateds live almost entirely under the forest cover, almost never flying out into the open. They&#8217;re shy. Usually, if you stop during a hike, hearing the tap-tap, tap-tap, and if you look around for the big black and white bird, he&#8217;ll slide quickly around to the other side of the trunk, peering out to see if you&#8217;re still there. If you are, he&#8217;ll flap away, ducking through the branches, looking too big to fly between them. Maybe he&#8217;ll give his dry, tuneless, clucking call.</p>

<p>But this one was bold. Maybe it was the wintry silence, the glittering snow, the still, cold, electric air. The sense of deep frozen quiet that February brings. Anyway he ignored me. He was perched halfway up a white pine, making a modest tap-tap, tap-tap, his big angular head nodding. The movement seemed offhand, as though he were just thinking about something. But these little taps were serious: pileated woodpeckers are the superheroes. This modest tapping was like someone holding a pickax by the throat, thudding it over and over. Pileated woodpeckers can drum at a speed of fifteen miles an hour, twenty times a second, and they produce a hole the size of a shoe-box with ease. </p>

<p>The pileated likes ants, particularly carpenter ants. He hops along a tree trunk, leaning close to it, sniffing for formic acid and listening carefully for anty sounds. He&#8217;s good at this. During the summer, ants run along the top of the bark, or just underneath it, and the woodpecker picks them off one at a time. During the winter, carpenter ants are dormant. The entire dozy swarm settles all together in the heart of a tree. There they lie until spring, when they will wake up and start consuming the tree, unless they&#8217;re discovered first by a wily woodpecker.</p>

<p>My pileated was after a swarm. He was hammering away with his chisel-shaped bill, sending out messy showers of bark and chips, and opening up a huge gaping hole of pale pinewood. He turned often to look at me, then back at the tree to chip away some more. Finally he hit something, down in the center of the tree. He stuck his head deep into the cavity, making little jerky movements, nodding and nosing. He was using his incredibly long tongue, which is agile and muscular, sipping up one sleepy ant after another.</p>

<p>He paused, pecked, paused, listened. He cocked his showy wild-striped head, then thrust it in again greedily, deep inside the cavity, to feast. He tossed out chips, dove in again, then turned to look at me, gulping down his breakfast.</p>

<p>I watched him for a while, drumming, dipping, shifting. Finally I started on quietly, leaving him there to feast in peace. But my movement scared him, and the tiny crunch of my poles in the snow, the rustling of my jacket were too much for him.</p>

<p>He drew his head back and opened his big black wings and flew off, low, through the branches, like a clumsy bomber. Furtive and quick, he vanished among the trees, calling his harsh, brief note.</p>

<p>Then there was silence, just the faint whisper of wind against the snow.</p>

<p>Catbird</p>

<p>Up on the hillside, by the swimming pool there was a big summer border. It was about thirty feet long and eight feet deep, and there I put the plants I had never wanted – or dared – to put in the lower gardens by the house. Up in the summer border I put yellow plants – the buttery oenethera, and a sunny yarrow &#8211; and bright red plants – a tiny crimson potentilla – and once I even planted an apricot-colored David Austen rose, though I never went all the way to orange. </p>

<p>I also put huge plants up there, ones that would have overpowered the modest borders behind the house. I put in towering Joe Pye weeds, and a fancy statuesque silver plant &#8211; something argentea?? &#8212; that soared majestically upwards for one season and then lay moping flatly in the bed until I threw it out. I planted a huge whispering clump of miscanthus in the far corner, and in the middle a colony of tall soft blurry filipendula rubrus, and a sprawling blue perovskia. Just beyond the border was a big purple buddleia. </p>

<p>The summer border was in full sun, and it came into bloom in July and August, after the sweeter pinks and blues of the June borders, which were down by the house. The summer border was bolder and wilder, out under the open sky, backed by our sloping meadow, facing, beyond the pool, the deep woods.</p>

<p>I liked working up there. It felt quite distant from civilisation; it was out of sight and out of sound of the house. I&#8217;d go up to work in the garden and listen to the birds. There were a lot of birds up there. Several families of house wrens lived nearby, one of them nesting in one of the little lanterns that hung on either side of the pool house door. That wren spent her days hunting insects in the summer border. She was incredibly conscientious. Whenever I arrived and walked over to the border, she would suddenly fly out of the tall plants at the back, the phlox or filipendula, scolding me at the top of her lungs for the interruption. She sat on the split-rail fence and complained, in a tiny, shrill, energetic, voluble stream. It didn’t really feel like abuse, it felt more like an exclamation. It felt as though we were sharing something, and as though she needed to express an opinion. </p>

<p>There were cardinals and robins, tree swallows, skimming over the meadow. Sometimes I saw the brilliant flash of a baltimore oriole, high in one of the hickory trees, but I never saw the nest. </p>

<p>The split-rail fence ran all the way around the pool. On the far side of the pool, beyond the fence, the ground sloped down through the woods, and down into a sort of boggy shrubby series of thickets. The thickets began just beyond the fence, huge overgrown wild honeysuckle bushes. Some of these had the usual cream-colored blossoms, but one of them, very large, was pink. I looked forward each spring for this to bloom, when the whole enormous rounded mass of the bush looked as though it was covered in delicate rosy-cream butterflies. It was a lovely presence, a sort of gift from the woods, as it never needed pruning or watering or feeding, and always blossomed in that spectacularly generous way.</p>

<p>A catbird nested in it. Or at least I think she did. I saw her slipping in and out of it, but by the time she built her nest the bush was too densely leafed-out for me to see the nest itself. In any case there were catbirds up there, around the summer border and the pool house. Sometimes they’d sit on the fence-posts and watch me; sometimes they’d sing their modest repertoire of other birds’ songs, from deep in the bushes. I knew it was them, singing. </p>

<p>I like catbirds, with their neat grey suits, their black trim, their elegant graphics. I like the way they move, which is quiet but confident, like someone on a diplomatic mission. And catbirds, oddly enough, like us. That catbird would come out of her honeysuckle bush when I came up to the border, and she would perch on a fencepost, watching. She was a curious, observant bird, though why she wanted to watch me pulling out weeds I don’t know. She had her own life, though, and her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Once I was walking through the little gate in the fence, toward the pool, and I felt something brush suddenly against the back of my head. I was thirty feet away from the house, and there was no vine or tree near. But something had made contact, something had swept deliberately against my hair, against my skull. It didn’t feel hostile, but it was startling, a tiny shock. Intimate. I turned around and saw the catbird sitting on the gatepost, her head cocked, watching me, her eye bright and black. She had her reasons for that swift, delicate encounter. I don’t know what they were. </p>

<p>I think about that sometimes, that soft brushing sweep against my hair. Turning to see her, surprised, and finding her vibrant eye upon me. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s nearly high tide, and the cove is glassy. The water is a flat silver mirror, smooth and still. It looks as though it&#8217;s never been touched by the wind, or an oar, or by the daily churning surge of the tide. It&#8217;s motionless.</p>

<p>The trees on the far shore &#8211; firs and pines, with a few bright-leaved hardwoods &#8211; are reflected with magical precision. They look like a doubled row, spreading both up into the air and down into the water, their trunks meeting seamlessly at the shoreline. It&#8217;s perfectly, perfectly calm.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve come out onto the deck. On the water below me, on this side of the cove, I become aware of a small disruption. Through the trees I can see a skein of fine lines on the water, like a web, radiating outward. It comes from the southeast corner &#8211; the opposite end from the cove&#8217;s mouth, where it leads to the sea. There&#8217;s no stream in that corner, and I wonder what could have started this disturbance. A tiny puff of air, turning the flat surface into a net of ripples? But why would it start in that wooded corner?</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t stop, this mysterious rippling. It spreads out across the cove, and as I watch I think I see something on the water. My view is partly obscured, by trees and bushes, and I go down the steps and head quietly for the shore. The path through the woods is covered with a fresh fall of needles, already an autumnal reddish-buff, and they muffle my footsteps. I&#8217;m watching the water as I walk, and by now the whole cove is criss-crossed with a network of ripples. Who is doing this? How has someone shattered the smooth glassy surface so silently, so mysteriously, so completely? The upside down trees are now shattered into liquid shards, clashing loosely in the glimmering wash.</p>

<p>Heading down the slope I glimpse something moving toward the far side of the cove. When I reach the shore I stop, just inside the fringe of shoreline bushes, and lift my binoculars. </p>

<p>What&#8217;s out there is a female merganser. Her head is rusty red, her body mostly grey, with a soft whitish streak along her waterline and a bright white patch near her tail. </p>

<p>She carries her rufous head high, her long red bill slanted slightly upward. On the crown of her head is a wild crest, and its long feathers stick out wildly, radiating like a ragged sunburst. She looks as though she&#8217;s just gotten out of bed, as though she&#8217;s trying out a Mohawk. She&#8217;s steaming along in the water, paddling like mad. It&#8217;s she, with her messy hair and ragged wake, who has unsettled the entire cove. Now all of it is rocking quietly, the fretwork of ripples sliding across the whole of the little inlet.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s heading fast for the opposite side of the cove, getting further away every second. I step closer to the shore, my binoculars raised. I step past the big branches of a fir tree, to see better. I&#8217;m still beneath the tree, but I&#8217;m now out in the open, and fully visible. Suddenly the merganser takes off, flapping wildly, splashing and shattering the rocking water. She flies low over the surface, noisy and urgent, her wings wide and wild, the bright patch near her tail flashing. This is no slipping silently out of sight, this is an emrgency exit, panicky, cacaphonous, tumultuous. </p>

<p>In a few moments the cove is empty, and I step out of cover, onto the shoreline. By now the whole surface is distressed. Now it looks like ragged scumbled water anywhere &#8211; uneasy, unsettled and in flux, a zillion tiny shards of rocking reflection. And there&#8217;s no-one here, no other birds, no ducks, no creatures. I stand, disappointed, at the edge of the water. It was that crazy merganser, with her wild messy hairdo, who did all this. That&#8217;s who left the cove in such turmoil, and uninhabited.</p>

<p>But it was really me. I know that. If I hadn&#8217;t been there, she wouldn&#8217;t have left. </p>

<p>Before it rises and turns onto the shoulder of the hill, Town Street meanders through overgrown meadowland, now woods. On the uphill side it&#8217;s boggy. Actually it&#8217;s more than boggy: it&#8217;s a shallow pond, and in it is a handsome new home with a water view. Beavers have arrived.</p>

<p>The beaver (castor canadensis) is an engaging creature &#8211; all right, a rodent &#8211; with a sleek fur coat and a friendly, unthreatening manner. He has an inquisitive nose, a dextrous pair of forepaws, and a cool set of extra eyelids, transparent ones, like underwater goggles. Beavers are peaceful and intelligent, and they mate for life. In the animal world they are stars of cognitive behaviour: they reason, use tools, and build complex structures. They are remarkably adept and inventive engineers. In the winter, for example, they lower the water level so they can surface under the ice to breathe, without risk from predators. They are visionaries, and their projects are mighty: in northern Alberta there&#8217;s a beaver dam 2,790 feet long.</p>

<p>They are wonderful animals on someone else&#8217;s land, though on yours they might seem problematic. Beavers alter the landscape more than any other creature except man. They are unstoppable. Tireless, resourceful and determined, beavers want things their way, and that way is a big pond with a lodge in the middle and a dam along the downstream edge. It may not be what you had in mind, but before you consider eviction, consider the beaver&#8217;s place in the world.</p>

<p>The beaver is a naturalist&#8217;s dream: everything he does is good for the planet. Castor canadensis is a keystone species, creating rich habitat for fish, ducks, wading birds, turtles, amphibians and frogs. But beavers do more than that. They&#8217;re like benevolent super-creatures, in charge of a system that sustains life on earth.</p>

<p>In natural hydrology, beavers are huge. Beaver dams, and the ponds&#8217; wide, absorbent edges, and the wetlands that surround them, provide natural flood protection. Beavers&#8217; quiet pondwaters allow young creatures of many species to thrive, and rich organic matter to settle. Their wetlands are portals to the aquifer, which provides us with groundwater. Beaver dams filter the streamwater that passes over them, producing bacteria which feed on the phosphates and nitrates from agricultural runoff. Miraculously, these bacteria devour pesticides and herbicides. And, as if all this were not enough, beavers have a sense of humor. They are known to enjoy playing practical jokes.</p>

<p>Okay, they cut down a lot of trees, and they put the pond where they want it, not where you do. If these are problems for you, help is available: get &#8220;Coexisting with Beavers,&#8221; which offers solutions like the Beaver Deceiver and the Castor Master. Go on the web to <a href="http://www.beaversww.org">www.beaversww.org</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s not in the Yankee spirit to let someone else move onto your land and develop it for his own purposes, but the beaver&#8217;s purposes are admirable. He&#8217;ll take down that scrubby woodlot and create a clean, glimmering, exquisite pond, filled with thriving wildlife. An earthly paradise on your property: isn&#8217;t this an offer you can&#8217;t refuse?</p>

<p>This region is rich in beavers. Recently, at their pond on Cream Hill Road, I noted mallards, Canada geese, a handsome grey heron and about a zillion spring peepers. Also a small dark head moving across the water, tugging a v-shaped wave, swimming steadily toward the rushes. Someone was hard at work, saving the planet.</p>

<p>At the corner of Rattlesnake Road and Cream Hill Road lies a sweep of open water, surrounded by reedy marshland. Historically, this kind of place had a bad reputation: bogs, swamps and marshes are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, as everyone knows, and everyone hates mosquitoes. And bogs offer a kind of irritating passive resistance &#8211; they&#8217;re too shallow to swim in, too deep to walk through. Difficult to navigate, they&#8217;re murky and secretive, full of darting creatures, thick reedy foliage and fine clouds of mud. We&#8217;ve never liked them. For a thousand years marshes have been routinely drained to eliminate mosquitoes, and make arable land. Recently, though, we&#8217;ve begun to learn the value in the natural hydrology system: bogs are loamy sinks, that allow water to seep deep into the aquifers on which we all depend. Now we&#8217;ve become more tolerant of them. And now we know that they&#8217;re good, we can see that they&#8217;re beautiful, too. Tall standing grasses edging quiet, dreaming water, a wide sheet of sky: still water has its own appeal.<br>
Something that has always liked bogs is the cattail, which grows with cheerful abandon along the water&#8217;s edge beside Rattlesnake Road. The common cattail<br>
<span></span> Typha latifolia <span></span>, is a handsome plant, with tall, flexible, sword-shaped leaves that bend casually away from the root. At the end of a stiff round stalk is a thick brown cigar-like club, surmounted by a bare spike. Cattails are monoeicious, so each plant contains both male and female parts, and is self-pollinating. The plushy brown cigar is the female part of the flower, the bare spike, the male part. The male flower ripens early to an insignificant pair of stamens that quickly disappear, but the female part is robust and long-lasting, and gives the plant its common name.<br>
Now, in the fall, the stalk is dry and limber, and holding one is oddly satisfying. It feels like a scepter, the brown club a modest, sold weight. It&#8217;s pleasant to wave it, as though it were a sparkler, inscribing its journey through the air.<br>
Actually, it is a bit like a sparkler, dispersing pollinated seeds like tiny points of light. The slightest touch on that dry plush will make it yield a finely shredded white substance, like a pillow leaking down. Fine white filaments radiate from the tiny seeds, like a miniature starburst. Floating airily on the breeze, these will drift for miles. They&#8217;ll settle anywhere, but what they need is bogland &#8211; quiet, shallow water &#8211; and sun.<br>
Unlike the non-natives &#8211; purple loose-strife, and phragmites &#8211; that threaten them, cattails offer habitat for lots of native creatures. They&#8217;re a favorite of another local favorite, the red-winged blackbird. Red-wings, with their handsome graphics (neat red, yellow and orange bars at the top of the glossy black wings, like the insignia for an Italian rcing club) arrive early in the spring, nesting in cattails when they can. Red-wings&#8217; cheerful buzzing whistle, their bold pale gold eyes and the vivid sheen of their plumage remind us each year that spring is back, and the landscape is waking up.<br>
And, like the answer to another of the ingeniouis natural puzzles that surround us, it turns out that red-wings don&#8217;t hate mosquitoes like everyone else. In fact, they love them. Boglands, cat-tails, red-wings, mosquitoes &#8211; there&#8217;s no end to it. Can it be that eveyrthing is good?  </p>

<p>Down by the cove, late afternoon. The tide is running out, which means that each moment the water is shallower, and any hapless fish still in it has less and less room to hide. Low tide is a good time to fish, but not a good time to be fish.</p>

<p>Someone who&#8217;s interested in this distinction is the belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon) who lives in our cove with his mate. He&#8217;s a biggish bird, about a foot long, from poll to tail. He has a thick neck and a rather comically big head, with a wild, rakish crest on top. Beneath his chin is a clean wide white collar, and below that a sort of blue jabot, over a spotless white shirt front. Everywhere else he&#8217;s a steely blue, though his wife has chestnut markings on her breast. He has a long, thick, pointed no-nonsense beak, which my bird book calls &#8220;daggerlike.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kingfisher&#8217;s Greek name, Alcyon, refers to two things in English: &#8220;halcyon blue&#8221; a bright kingfisherish hue, and &#8220;halcyon days,&#8221; a peaceful, cherished time. Both derive from a Greek legend about Alcyone, the daughter of Aeolus.</p>

<p>Alcyone was the wife of Ceyx, and they were very happy together &#8211; so happy that they called each other Hera and Zeus, in imitation of that most celebrated couple, the king and queen of the gods. The gods took offence at this, as always, and Zeus threw a thunderbolt to sink Ceyx&#8217;s ship and drown him. Poor Alcyone, maddened by grief, threw herself into the sea. Having destroyed them, the gods (famously poor at making up their minds) took pity on the devoted couple, and transformed them into loyal pair-bonding birds who live along the shore. Traditionally, the female kingfisher laid her eggs during the seven day period around the winter solstice, a time when there were no storms: the calm, halcyon days.</p>

<p>Our kingfishers stay in the cove all summer, flying from tree to tree, never far apart. They&#8217;re not hard to spot. Unlike the silent great blue heron, who achieves a zen-like invisibility while he hunts, the kingfisher seems to think that fish have no ears. He sounds like a typewriter, giving off a long, rapid, mechanical rattle, usually in flight. He perches near the water, watching for prey. When he sees an unwary fish, too close to the surface, the kingfisher descends in a swift bold swoop.</p>

<p>Just now I hear a loud splash and I look up to see him flying back to his perch on a scraggly white pine. Usually he sits still, but now he shifts back and forth, head twitching, his ragged crest sticking up in points like a punk-rocker&#8217;s. Arcing from his beak is a long silvery curve: quite a big fish, held firmly in that dagger-like bill. The fish squirms, protesting. He feels a mistake has been made. He still has a chance, and if he can get the kingfisher to drop him now he&#8217;ll fall straight into the water and swim away, safe. He twists violently, flashing in the sun. The kingfisher holds him still. He can&#8217;t risk opening his beak to get a better grip because in that instant the fish might squirm away in a daring aerial escape. The fish struggles, the kingfisher shifts from foot to foot, his bill clamped shut. Every second the fish is out of water brings him closer to not moving at all, so the longer the kingfisher stays still, the better his chances. The fish moves a lot, bucking and glittering: the more he moves, the better his chances.</p>

<p>Suddenly the kingfisher stretches his neck out and bobs his head violently; the fish vanishes. The kingfisher bobs some more, his head jerking, at some interior turmoil. Then he shakes himself all over and twitches his tail. The silver fish is gone. He is now in a different place. If he is still protesting, it no longer matters.</p>

<p>The kingfisher sits upright, jerking his tail briskly as though proving a point. Then he leaves his branch, swooping down low across the water, toward another tree, trailing his long rattling cry.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in Maine now, and the garden at midseason poses all sorts of problems, as it always does.<br>
What we have here is, for the most part, a native woodlands garden. By this I mean it&#8217;s in the woods, and it&#8217;s meant to be all native. But nowadays, staying native is kind of like swimming against a current.<br>
When our house was built, twelve years ago, building codes required that barricade to be built around the construction site. This was made of hay bales, and it was intended to prevent the bare soil from eroding. It was a very sensible plan, but one of the unintended consequences of this was that the gulley below that barricade, which slopes down to our little salt-water cove, is now full of native &#8211; but not local, and certainly not appropriate &#8211; meadow grasses from those innocuous hay-bales. These include goldenrod, thistles and creeping brambles, and they have established themselves with characteristic weedy vigor in the little ravine. That area was particularly vulnerable to colonisation because some of the trees had come down during the building process, letting in new light. So there was disturbed earth, changes in the habitat, and then the arrival of this wild band of invasive marauders, charging into the new countryside like a band of nomadic terrorists, horticulturally shouting and swinging their swords. These guys are tough, they&#8217;re determined and they&#8217;re mean.<br>
For the first few years I liked them.<br>
One new presence along the little streambed is buttercup, which creates a vivid golden river in the spring. Also there are native sedges, big beautiful sprays of hardy green, with the characteristic biting edge &#8211; sedges have edges, in case you didn&#8217;t know how to distinguish them from grasses &#8211; and their wonderful surrealistic interruptions along the leaf. I don&#8217;t know sedges very well, so I can&#8217;t name them, but some of them have lacy &#8220;tremblant&#8221; decorations along the top third of the leaf, which nod in the wind and catch the light, glittering like dangling earrings. Some of the sedges have rough burr-like interruptions on the stalk, stiff triangulated sculptural things like small art deco flowers. All these plants are native, hardy and handsome, and why would I want to see them go? But how am I to get rid of the goldenrod, the thistles, the brambles, which are shooting inappropriately up the pine-needled sides of the little ravine, even as I type this?<br>
Being an all-organic gardener makes this sort of situation difficult. I asked the local landscaping service what they would charge to dig up the plants that are there and plant big swathes of native ferns &#8211; ostrich, sensitive and hay-scented, just for starters. He said it would cost $10,000 just to dig it up, and we could talk later about the cost of the ferns, and planting them.<br>
I&#8217;ve thought about how this problem would have been solved twenty years ago, fifty, a hundred, two hundred years, before there were chemical sprays, or building codes that required me to truck in these big bales of invasive seeds. It seems that fossil fuels play a part in a lot of this. Without fossil fuels you didn&#8217;t use non-natives without enormous expense. Imagine bringing a bale of hay from another state by horse-drawn carriage. Imagine bringing Chinese bittersweet, African lilies, kudzu, or any other non-native invasive from another continent, and then disseminating it all across our own, without the use of fossil fuels. Just getting to another county would be a real journey. Time moved slowly before the combustion engine.</p>

<p>There have always been migrations within the plant world, but they always moved slowly. There were seeds or plants that were carried by wind or water, or the fur of animals, or the bellies of birds. These forces were controlled by natural elements &#8211; birds digested seeds within a certain distance of where they&#8217;d eaten them, animals shed their fur within their own territories, wind and water were indifferent to the survival of seeds, and so most seeds perished. These movements were slow, and the force of inertia was against them. We&#8217;re speeding up that process, as well as many others. It&#8217;s hard to say what will happen.</p>

<p>Pinching box: it’s a mysterious phrase. It might be an eccentric sort of fisticuffs, or an exquisite Asian torture, but in fact it’s a peaceful horticultural task, pleasant, solitary and satisfying.<br>
Each spring, my box bushes put out a yellow-green froth of new growth, tiny furled leaves that curl around themselves like empty peas. And each year, in the chilly spring sunlight, I pinch back the tender stems, asking the bush to spend its energy in more interior ways, to make a denser, bushier plant. It’s one of my favorite chores. <br>
As Henry Mitchell once wrote, a gardener’s passions are serial. One year it’s rugosa roses, and wherever you look, that’s all you see, because that’s all you think about. It’s also all you want to hear about. How can your friend want to talk about hemerocallis? Hasn’t she seen the gorgeous, crinkled, heartbreakingly intimate petals of “Gens Munk”? For rugosa rose is all there is, for you, right then.<br>
This year my passion is Buxus: box. I like the neat briskness of its single syllable, I like the mysterious eccentricity of the letter x. And of course I love the shrub itself, with its tidy compact habit and its obliging evergreen foliage, dense, glossy and problem-free. Modest, sturdy, discreet, it’s best-known as a handsome foil for showier plants, or as a hedge, or a backdrop for statuary. But just as you might see a painting for years before an unnoticed element of the composition suddenly rises up and claims your attention, so I found the decorous, conventional and ubiquitous box suddenly claimed mine.<br>
Twenty-five years ago we moved into an old white clapboard farmhouse, guarded by ancient and towering sugar maples. These cast deep shade across the front of the house, which was lined with dreary, conventional foundation-planting: scrawny azaleas, droopy Andromedas and dismal yew, underplanted by sterile pachysandra. Design by Edward Gorey.<br>
As a gardening neophyte, I knew better than everyone else, and I ripped most of this out. I planted lilacs and viburnum, and left the andromeda and pachysandra. The front of the house was bare all winter, but I didn’t care. All I wanted was flowers, and I never used the front door.<br>
The back of the house is where the action is &#8211; perennial borders, kitchen garden and, of course, the back door. Some years later, wanting structure, I planted box there. Two large and handsome Buxus Sempervirens flank the back door, where they lend (I hope) some dignity to this modest portal. On each side of the white gate is a Buxus Suffruticosa Sempervirens &#8211; English, or Edging Box, small-leaved and slow-growing, enchantingly neat in its habit, dense and compact. In the corner of the Kitchen Garden, is a small, low, glossy Korean Box (Buxus Microphylla koreana.) This has a cheerful, hoydenish habit, like a mop, and turns a bright chartreuse in the winter.<br>
Once the bushes were planted, I realised that my buxus responsibilities had just begun. Pruning box turned out to be an art, one I approached with trepidation. My friend Ellen was no help. “I just pinch it every time I walk past,” she told me carelessly: the kind of comment made by someone very experienced, and useless to a nervous beginner. Where did she make the pinches, and how big were they? How often did she walk past? <br>
An English pruning book, Craftsmanship in Yew and Box, explained that shape was crucial. The plant must taper upward for sunlight to reach the bottom, which is why the great ancient box hedges have a stately pyramidal form. To create this shape – since leaning over the bush you can lose perspective – you use a wooden form. I nailed laths together to make a big slanted L, with an angle of about 50 degrees. Leaning this against the plant I began hesitantly to pinch.<br>
For you don’t clip box. Just as important as the shape is the method of pruning. Clippers produce unsightly white dashes throughout the foliage; the edges of the leaves and stems turn a hard and unpleasant white afterwards, no matter how carefully you wield the shears. Instead you pinch, with index finger and thumb. This is slow, and rather hard on your fingers, but it’s a pleasant task, and one you can do early, when there isn’t much else to do.<br>
Standing in the damp bed, still in a winter jacket, I take the tender shoots between finger and thumb and I like to think of the gallant ladies of Dunbarton Oaks. The big Washington garden, one of Beatrix Farrand’s masterpieces, contains a great deal of handsome box. I’d heard that, during World War II, much of the gardening staff was called up, and neighborhood ladies stepped into the breach. In their pleated skirts and pearls they pinched back the box, shoot by tender shoot, personal contributions to the War Effort.<br>
But what about the barren front of the house, neglected and untended all these years? Last summer, my daughter was married at home, on the lawn. The ceremony would be by the White Border, beside the fragrant and blooming rugosa Schneekoppe: perfect. But every single guest would walk across the lawn, past the dismal front door, the spindly lilacs and viburnums, the dull pachysandra. Buxus began beating a refrain in my brain.<br>
I began seeing Box. I saw box hedges. I saw topiary in photographs. I noticed huge bushes flanking ancient doorways. I met a collector of old box, buying it from estates. He has a property full of these noble centenarians, a private Forest of Arden. He doesn’t pinch them back, he said.<br>
Never? I asked. He shook his head.<br>
What do they look like, I asked, unclipped?<br>
Like clouds, he answered. <br>
Now I lamented. Twenty-five years, I thought. I could have had twenty-five-year-old box bushes, dense, luxuriant, graceful, green floating clouds flanking the doorway. Instead, I had twenty-five-year-old pachysandra beds, sterile, stupid and common, which I now detested.<br>
Two weeks before the wedding, talking with Joe, my gardening ally, I rued aloud my lack of box &#8211; though I knew I couldn’t put English box in deep shade.<br>
“But American box,” Joe said, “does fine in shade.”<br>
“It does?” I asked. The stealthy beat began in my brain.<br>
Joe nodded.<br>
“I’d need two big ones,” I said. Buxus Buxus Buxus.  <br>
“I can get two big ones,” Joe said.<br>
“Right away?” I asked.<br>
“This afternoon.”<br>
The bushes went in within hours. I hoped they’d look as though they’d been there for decades, but of course they did not: one thing money cannot buy is established plants. These looked as new arrivals always do: somewhat unkempt, but cheerful and well-intentioned. I didn’t care. I loved them.<br>
The wedding, like all weddings, was enchanting. And in twenty-five years I’ll have huge, dreamlike, green clouds flanking the front door. In the meantime, I think about the boxes. I walk several times a day around the house to look at them. Hoping they’re growing. Silently urging them on. Wondering why my friends want to talk about rugosas.</p>

<p>Op-Ed, The Boston Globe</p>

<p>From my desk I can see a line of trees, along the stone wall, that marks the edge of a sloping hillside pasture. The trees along the wall were probably not planted, but sprang up as sturdy wild seedlings missed by mowers. There are some sugar maples and hickories, but most are white ash, Fraxinus americana. This is common in our region – southeastern New York and New England – but it’s a robust and adaptable species, flourishing from Canada to Florida, with cousins in Britain and Europe.<br>
Living here for thirty years, I’ve come to know the white ash well – its fine, pointed, feathery leaves, its high, graceful, branching shape, its ridged and furrowed grey bark. In the fall, ash leaves turn subtle hues of bronze and mauve, in counterpoint to the yellow radiance of the sugar maples, the scarlet of the swamp maples. The shape of a young ash, like the ones along the wall, is high and narrow, but an older ash spreads out, grand and monumental, becoming finally wider than it is tall. And it can be very tall: early European arrivals reported ash trees 175 feet high, and 300 years old.<br>
When we first moved to this farmhouse a huge, majestic white ash stood near the barn, spreading its long swooping branches above our lawn for forty or fifty feet. It was, we were told, the largest white ash in the county, about two hundred years old. Its vast presence took up most of the aerial space between the house and the barn – towering, capacious and immensely calming. To lie on the lawn beneath its shade, gazing up into its airy open center, watching the silvery flutter of its narrow leaves, was to feel encompassed by peace.<br>
The ash tree – and the others &#8211; are more than just beautiful, however. Trees provide us with very practical benefits. Their strengths are quiet ones: calming, cooling, moisturising and nourishing. They lower the temperature, cause condensation and increase precipitation – more rain will fall on a forest than on open land. Their fallen leaves enrich the soil, and their root systems help rainwater descend toward the aquifer.<br>
More than that: trees are our lungs.<br>
We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide, and by some miraculous law of exchange, trees do exactly the opposite. When we inhale, they exhale: we’re breathing partners. Using the vast shifting surfaces of their leaves, trees absorb the carbon dioxide we produce from our lungs, our factories and our engines. By means of a marvelous alchemy they transform this waste – and not just carbon dioxide, but other noxious gases, dust and pollutants as well &#8211; into the sweet fresh air we need. A mature, leafy, healthy tree provides enough oxygen for a family of four. We need trees. And the more our population increases, and the more carbon dioxide we produce, the more trees we need.<br>
* * *<br>
The ashes on our hillside are dying. The upper branches are nearly bare, and the remaining leaves were already yellowish at midsummer. They’re suffering from ash die-back, a non-specific ailment which is more and more widespread. Die-back causes a gradual decline: the circulatory system becomes increasingly feeble. Insects and disease are more dangerous to a weakened tree, which can’t muster the resources to replace destroyed foliage, or fight off bacteria. Each year the tree has fewer leaves, and finally none at all, and the big skeleton stands grey and gaunt against the sky. Die-back is what killed our big ash, though we fed and coddled it for twenty years. It troubles me that it died under our watch.<br>
The tree people don’t know exactly why die-back has become so prevalent; they shake their heads and suggest that you plant something else instead. Sugar maples, maybe – though those, too, aren’t as hardy as they used to be. It’s strange about ashes: they’ve been a vigorous part of the local landscape for at least two hundred years. And the ones along the stone walls are young, only fifty or sixty years old. They’re not dying of old age, but something else.<br>
* * *<br>
For decades we’ve been warned about global warming. Thirty years ago, scientists painted a picture of universal calamity, like a science fiction movie: floods, droughts, storms, fires. Since the scenarios were so dire, and since the remedy – mainly the reduction of oil and gas use – would so powerfully affect the American economy, the government urged caution. It was possible, we were told, that the risks were exaggerated. It was possible, we were told, that the buildup of greenhouse gases – mostly carbon dioxide and methane – was not caused by human activity. Scant encouragement was given to alternative energy sources: they were impractical, we were told. As the years have passed, the warnings have continued, and so has the burning of fossil fuels.<br>
By now we know it’s happening. One effect of greenhouse gas buildup is the disruption of weather patterns. We’re aware that our weather has become uncertain, unreliable and often extreme. Sudden and unseasonal heat waves and cold snaps, torrential rains, floods, droughts, high winds and severe storms are all now common. To people this may be only an inconvenience, but in the natural world erratic weather wreaks havoc. Most living organisms have evolved, over millenia, in response to reliable weather patterns. When those are disrupted, the organism is at risk.<br>
Take trees, for example, the white ash. Deciduous trees drop their leaves before the fierce storms of winter. This is part of an efficient natural engineering system: bare branches offer little resistance to high winds, and catch little snow. But if high winds occur in midsummer, or if there’s an early snowfall, when the leaves are still on the tree, the system fails. In high winds, the leaves act like sails, catching the wind, and they’re ripped from the tree. An early snowfall is worse: the leaves hold the snow, the limbs can’t support the weight, and they fall. Loss of limbs, and unseasonal loss of leaves, weaken the tree and put it at risk.<br>
Temperature changes are important, too. Sap descends, in the fall, and spends the winter deep in the tree’s lower regions. An unseasonal warm spell in January signals the approach of spring, and the sap begins its long climb upward. A return of cold weather requires the system to reverse itself. Both mean the wasting of energy, which trees can’t afford. Good survival strategies save energy, not waste it. A tree under stress is susceptible to disease and death, and erratic weather places all trees under constant stress. The rise of die-back begins to make sense.<br>
* * *<br>
It seems that the debate is over about the causes of global warming. The recent government report on “Our Changing Planet” states with certainty that “Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane have been increasing for about two centuries as a result of human activities and are now higher than they have been for about 400,000 years.” Here “human activities” means, mostly, the combustion of fossil fuels, of which the United States is responsible for a disproportionately large amount.<br>
The report contains ominous news about melanoma, (now officially an epidemic cancer), and certain plants, but perhaps the worst news is about trees. A study of fluctuating precipitation levels showed that old trees could withstand this, but young trees were not. Fluctuation interfered with the young trees’ ability to absorb nutrients, and increased their mortality rate. Erratic precipitation is already a result of our unreliable weather. If the weather of the future threatens the survival of young trees, how will the forest reproduce itself?<br>
* * *<br>
It’s good that the government is studying the climate crisis; it’s good that they’ve finally acknowledged the cause, but the response is baffling. The report suggests urgent action, but the Bush administration’s response is anything but urgent. Instead of reducing the use of fossil fuels, it’s encouraging an increase. The Bureau of Land Management plans to auction off parts of Yellowstone Park for oil and gas development; the US Forest Service is considering opening national forests to commercial logging; the Department of the Interior plans to accelerate oil and gas drilling, and the EPA is trying to protect Exxon and others from key provisions of the Clean Air Act.<br>
Global warming affects everyone on the planet. All of us here are interconnected in subtle ways, but the most striking link may be that between our lungs and our forests. Our determined commitment to fossil fuels means the subjection of our generous silent partners to increasingly lethal conditions: pollution, erratic weather, clear-cut logging and acid rain. All these things are necessary for a healthy economy, we’re told.<br>
But what about healthy lungs? What do we plan to breathe?<br>
* * *<br>
Four years ago the great ash died. I planted in its place a white oak,<br>
Quercus alba. The white oak is a noble tree; no other has a broader reach, deeper roots, or more expansive possibilities. Its stout taproot runs so deep, and its innumerable rootlets spread so wide, that the underground tree is nearly a shadowy mirror image of the one above. A white oak can live for five centuries, towering peacefully over the landscape. Rugged, monumental, and unthinkably generous, it can provide cool shade to creatures below, shelter and food to birds in its midst, and pure, sweet air for generations &#8211; to my grandchildren’s children, wherever in the world they may live.<br>
I want to see that young oak rising straight and tall against the red barn. I want to see a line of wild ashes along the stone wall, full and green against the sky. I want to see each high branch loaded and brimming with bright shimmery leaves. Then I’ll breathe easy.</p>

<p>One of the great pleasures of the garden lies in its textures – the lace of ferns, the velvet of roses, the smooth fluted curves of hosta. Boxwood’s texture has a particular appeal, especially now – September &#8211; when everything else is in decline. Box is still dense and vigorous, the leaves bright dark green and shiny, the surface of the shrub dense and springy, somehow luxuriant.</p>

<p>My back door is flanked by two pyramidal boxes, five feet high (1). Every time I go in and out I pass this stout reliable presence, the dry green thicket of tiny leaves. There are tall willow trees nearby, and their pale narrow leaves and fine whippy twigs often drop into the dark green of the box, which is why I almost didn’t notice the casual strip of brown, flung across the shoulder of the box this morning. A long looped line, in smooth curves, like a necklace dropped by the gods.</p>

<p>It was a snake. Its body drew a narrow sinuous line through the leaves. It was dark grey, nearly black, with pale bold stripes running the length of it. I could see the narrow tapering tail, curled inward, but the head was invisible, inside the box. For long moments the snake was motionless among the leaves, and I began to wonder if it were dead. Then I saw a faint thickening swell, like a swell of water in the ocean, and then, magically, the long line of it moving without moving, slid inside the deep green interior of the box and was gone.</p>

<p>Later, when I came outside he was there again. His head was stretched out into the air. His jewelled, brilliant eyes were black against the clean stripes. We stared at each other without moving, and then his mouth flashed open. Flickering suddenly into the air like electricity was his narrow threadlike tongue. It was dark glistening carmine at the roots, glistening black at the forked end. The forked end snapped like a banner. He flicked it, flicked, flicked again, staring straight at me like a hypnotist. Then he stopped, still staring, and drew his head in and turned in on himself, collecting himself in loops. He slid away, deep inside the beautiful dense green plush of the boxwood.</p>

<p>It’s still cool here, the temperature’s in the fifties, which is balmy for winter but rather chilly and spinsterish for spring. I’ve been wearing my jacket this afternoon, doing errands. Still, there are hints that things are on the move: the earth in the borders has darkened, it’s no longer the still dead grey of winter, but a richer brown, though it’s blank and empty. At the heart of the dead grey waterfall of the sprawling nepeta there are tiny pale heads, thrusting themselves upwards. And the lawn: the lawn has made a bold and sweeping declaration: emerald.<br>
But it’s still chilly, and I’ve not yet been tempted to roll up my sleeves and start messing around in the garden, pruning things too early and stepping on new peony roots as I try to see if they’re there: it’s still too cold.<br>
There are other ways, though, that the message is being delivered.<br>
Tonight I went out running in the dark, along the dirt road and through the high bare trees, that moved faintly and mysteriously, though there was no wind. The air was sharp and fresh and damp. When I turned up Mt. Holly Road and went over the swampy part, coming over the bridge, it swept over me suddenly and for a moment I closed my eyes: peepers.<br>
The whole hollow swelled with that high eerie hallelujah. I ran through it, feeling it shrilling around me in the darkness, lifting us all toward spring in a wild exalting rush.<br>
And when I got home, still elated, and back to our barn driveway, beyond the sound of the chorus, I opened the gate and stepped into the pasture, and into another of spring’s announcements: the dense, heady, opulent perfume of skunk: wide awake, sociable, and very nearby.<br>
Then I stopped, and took a long, ecstatic breath. I couldn’t get enough: it’s here.</p>

<p>This afternoon I went out walking along the river. Coming back uphill by the road, I looked ahead and saw a young fox loping easily across the road. Just behind her was a kit, small and caramel-colored, thickly furred, and anxious. He was so small that at first I thought he was a squirrel, with his long dense tail. When she got to the far side, he stalled, turned, and bolted back to where he’d started, a small bluff covered with brush. He ran into the bushes and started yapping, high little haphazard barks that sounded as though he hadn’t quite figured out where the noise came from. He was still back up in there, complaining, but the vixen turned around and went on across the road, down the hill into a brushy ravine on the other side.<br>
I walked up the road past both of them, now hidden. I was surprised that she’d let him go back up the bluff alone, and at the top of the hill I turned around to look back. Nothing. But I heard some barks way down in the ravine. I waited, and after awhile the vixen appeared, with another kit.<br>
The vixen was young and light-colored, slightly brindled. She was slim and lithe and pretty, a hard-working single mom with dinner to make, trying to get her naughty son to behave. She trotted across the road toward the bluff and turned to look at him. He skittered wildly along the edge of the road, like a dustrag with pointed ears.<br>
The vixen stood waiting, and then a car came up from the river, roaring toward us, and both foxes retreated into the brush. We all waited until the noise died down, and then they emerged. The vixen trotted across the road again to get her son. Foxes are too cool ever to look anxious, but her tongue was hanging out. She looked a bit harried.<br>
Back on the ravine side, the kit came out of the brush and she trotted again across the road away from him, turning to look at him. He went right up to the edge of the road and then stalled, turned and started skittering alongside it, headed toward me, yapping like a high-pitched banging door. Yap, yap, yap, yap, he yelled. MA! MA! MA! MA!<br>
Mom stood waiting on the other side. Another car came by, and everyone hid.<br>
A huge SUV drove up behind me, and I waved it down. The tinted window came down, a big guy in sunglasses at the wheel. “What’s going on?”<br>
“A mother fox is trying to get her kit across the road. See her by the telephone pole? If you could wait a minute, maybe she’ll do it.”<br>
Pretty soon there were three stopped cars, everyone watching that kit.<br>
The mom saw we were all waiting for her, and she headed back to the ravine side again. Once there she turned and looked at her son, ready to cross back. The kit skittered nervously up to the edge of the road. We all stood waiting. He stuck his nose in the air. MA!<br>
No-one moved.<br>
He put one paw on the pavement.<br>
No-one moved.<br>
He spread his legs out wide and lowered his belly as though he were climbing onto a rocking boat, and, very slowly, legs splayed, he moved out onto that tricksy, swaying pavement.<br>
No-one moved.<br>
Yelling his head off, his belly flat on the road, his legs out like a crab’s, he scrabbled all the way across. The mom jumped up to meet him and the two of them vanished into the brush, headed for the bluff, that baby still flapping his mouth.<br>
MA!</p>

<p>Op-Ed, The Philadelphia Inquirer</p>

<p>Polar bears are the largest land carnivores, reaching mythic proportions: twelve feet high, two thousand pounds. They have forty-two ivory teeth, and their paws are twelve inches wide, with curved, nonretractable, lethal claws. Polar bears have no animal enemies: nothing they meet is bigger or fiercer than they are. They are supreme.<br>
Most of us will never see a polar bear in its native habitat, which adds to its glamour and mystery. Polar bears &#8211; ursus maritimus – are found throughout the circumpolar Arctic, ranging like ghostly shadows across the sea ice off the coastlines of Siberia, Greenland, Canada, Iceland and Alaska. Over a hundred thousand years or so they’ve adapted brilliantly to life in a punishing, icy moonscape, where temperatures drop to 90 below zero. Their soft, dense fur has turned to misty silver, for camouflage. The most pelagic (maritime) of their kind, polar bears are insulated by a thick layer of fat and a smooth, water-repellent coat. They swim for long distances through frigid seas; one was tracked swimming for 60 miles without stopping.<br>
The polar bear preys on marine mammals, mostly seals. He hunts by stalking and by “still hunting” – waiting, poised and motionless, by an ice hole, for an unwary seal to surface. Sea ice is the bear’s habitat, a perforated platform on which to encounter his prey. It is the bear’s home territory, his own vast, shifting, unstable continent. Sea ice &#8211; thick, solid and plentiful – is essential to the bear’s survival.<br>
But sea ice itself is endangered. As the planet warms, the rising temperatures are melting the tundra, the glaciers, and the ice caps, destroying the polar bear’s world. The whole arctic landscape, that misty, fantastical world of glaciers, icebergs, floes and pack ice, is vanishing. At summer’s end, the great white bears now find themselves far out to sea, trapped on melting ice floes. They set out to swim, but the distances are too great even for them: polar bears are drowning. In the last five years their population has dropped by twenty per cent, with no relief in sight. The melting arctic ice reduces the hunting range and puts the whole population at risk. Among reproductive females, body weight is dropping, reducing the ability to bear offspring.<br>
Ursus maritimus may be doomed. Even if he’s classified as endangered, there’s no way to protect a portion of the landscape as a wildlife preserve for him. His habitat is ice and snow, and the entire frozen Arctic ocean is melting. So in our lifetimes we may lose him, that great pale shadow that has lived so vividly in the north of our imaginations &#8211; enormous, shimmering, powerful, at once fearsome and comforting &#8211; padding silently across the glittering wastes. The polar bear may soon be something we’ll tell our children about, like snow.<br>
Global warming is no longer an ominous possibility but a reality: there is no longer substantive disagreement within the scientific community about its existence. The Bush administration’s own 2004 report stated that greenhouse gases are the “result of human activities and are now higher than they have been for about 400,000 years.” It’s happening, now, and because of us.<br>
The United States is the leading producer of greenhouse gases. It’s also a model of energy policy for the developing world. Our resolute refusal to accept our own scientific counsel, our insistent denial of the consequences of our actions provide a dangerous example for the developing world. We may deeply regret setting such an example, since the developing world will soon outstrip us in greenhouse gas production.<br>
In the meantime, the rest of the world is held hostage to our fossil-fuel fueled agenda, defenseless against US policies. Indigenous Arctic people and polar bears are helpless before our destruction of their way of life. Glaciers are melting worldwide, in Africa, the Andes, the Himalayas, and the Alps, but no-one can demand a change in US policy. Americans, too, are affected. Important aspects of our own economy – travel, communication, shipping, hotel, insurance and agriculture, not to mention public health – are increasingly affected by the severe, unseasonal and unpredictable weather that is increasingly common, and which has been identified as a result of global warming.<br>
It’s not just the arctic that we’re losing, it’s the notion of the whole world as we first learned it: icy and blizzarding, cracking with cold, at the poles; deep and green and humid, lush with life, in the tropical rain forests; vivid and dense, teeming with birds and fish in the river deltas. Rich, gorgeous, strange, full of a life beyond our control: that was the world we were given; the world we understood was ours. How can we give it up? How can we knowingly destroy it?<br>
Maybe the loss of that last, great, dreamlike animal will rouse us. Maybe now we’ll take a stand and insist on preventing these changes that threaten something so distant, so close, so essential.</p>

<p>Op-Ed, The Boston Globe, The International Herald Tribune</p>

<p>Near my back door is a tall, straggly plant with dull, nearly colorless flowers. After a heavy rain, the stalks collapse against each other. It’s a mess. If you saw it you’d think it was a weed, and you’d be right. I planted it.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Gardens are about beauty, and that’s how I choose my plants. I hope they’ll thrive. I hope they’ll bloom. I hope they won’t be shredded by insects.<br>
Insects are a big presence in my garden, since I don’t use toxic chemicals. Each year it’s a race to see which comes first, the end of summer or the end of the garden. I’m tempted, of course, by chemicals. If beauty is the goal, chemicals seem the quickest way to reach it: a quick misting and the aphids are gone; a morning’s dousing and the brick walk is weed-free.<br>
I don’t use them, though.<br>
I’m not a chemist, and can’t follow the science, but I’m uneasy about their smooth eradicatory sweep. There’s nothing smooth and absolute about nature, which works in messy ebbs and flows. And I wonder about people who worked the soil before us &#8211; the wheat farmers of Sicily, breadbasket of the Roman Empire. How did they manage? Now it seems you can hardly grow a blade of grass without chemical assistance, but historically, people produced bounteous harvests without help from Ortho.<br>
In my garden, (and many others), plants thrive without chemicals. They do fine on sun, water, compost and attention, as they have since the first human planted the first yam. Synthetic chemicals are new: it’s only about fifty years since they’ve been widely used by backyard gardeners like me. Now they’re everywhere. The labels look cheery but carry ominous small-print warnings: no-one knows their long-term consequences. On summer evenings children used to run alongside the DDT truck, letting its cool spray coat their arms and legs.<br>
My English roses were attacked every year by small green defoliating caterpillars. I sprayed with Bt, or bacillus thuringiensis, a naturally occurring organism that attacks the digestive tracts of caterpillars. It doesn’t affect vertebrates and it breaks down without a trace. It took care of those caterpillars within minutes. If beauty is the end, Bt seemed a safe, easy means of reaching it.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>I hope my homely back-door plant will thrive, but not that the insects will leave it alone. I want it ripped to shreds, big holes in the foliage, weighed down by visiting insects.<br>
The homely plant is is asclepius syriaca, the common milkweed, and the destructive visitor I hope for is Danaus plexippus, the gorgeous monarch butterfly.<br>
The monarch, with its ember-colored, black-edged wings, may be the most beautiful of all butterflies; certainly it’s the most famous. The Latin name refers to the ancient king Danaus, who is known for a long journey: so is the monarch.<br>
Every fall, all monarchs in the Northern Hemisphere travel over a thousand miles. The West Coast monarchs head for Monterey, California, and the East Coast butterflies – including those by my back door in Maine – fly to central Mexico. No-one knows how they survive the vagaries of high-altitude travel, the buffeting thumps of airplane traffic, El Nino.<br>
Most monarchs live for about six weeks. The single butterfly you think you see all summer may actually represent several generations. The last, hatching in the fall, is called Methuselah, and survives from six to nine months – long enough to reach the winter retreat and spend the season. No-one knows how the Methuselahs find it, since they’ve never been there.<br>
* * *<br>
Milkweeds, the asclepias family, are essential to monarchs. The butterflies only lay their eggs on milkweed. The eggs hatch into larvae &#8211; caterpillars – which eat the leaves; the caterpillar forms a chrysalis from which the butterfly emerges. Every monarch on the planet depends on the presence of milkweed.<br>
* * *</p>

<p>I have two asclepia varieties: syriaca, the common one, and incarnata, prettier, more refined. Every morning I find an amber monarch near them. Brilliant, fire-colored, it alights, wings pulsing slowly, in, out. On the leaves are bright striped caterpillars, soft and plump, eating their way to splendor.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>You used to see milkweed everywhere – ditches, fields, the backs of buildings, along parking lots – anywhere no one was looking. In the fall, milkweed produces a thick brown pod, tightly packed with seeds. Each has a filmy, fibrous kite to catch the wind. You see them seldom now.<br>
* * *<br>
We no longer tolerate milkweed. It produces a disagreeable substance called cardenolide alkaloid. Monarchs absorb this, which protects them from bird predation. Cardenolide alkaloids can be toxic to cattle, though, so cattle farmers dislike milkweed. Crop growers dislike it because it’s a weed. The traditional means of eliminating weeds is through tilling, which is probably what the Sicilian wheat-growers did. Tilling eliminates most weeds, though some always survived. Until now, it wasn’t possible to eradicate a plant altogether.<br>
Most of monarch/milkweed habitat occurs in farmland, which is vanishing at nearly 3,000 acres a day. Most of the remaining habitat is owned by agribusiness, which increasingly grows corn and soybeans, our big commercial crops, from genetically modified (GM) seed. The GM crops can resist glyphosphate, which is the active ingredient in the herbicide RoundUp. Milkweed cannot: the GM switch has caused the loss of 80 million acres of monarch habitat. Roadside milkweeds, too, are being sprayed into extinction by our towns. Backyard gardeners are in on this – anyone who uses herbicides to tidy up. Even organic gardeners, like me – remember those tiny caterpillars, and the Bt?<br>
* * *</p>

<p>The monarch and the milkweed will soon disappear. The decisions affecting this are economic, and everyone knows that economics come before beauty. Everyone knows that commerce comes before conservation. Everyone knows that anything legally available is safe for the next generation.<br>
Or maybe everyone doesn’t know this. Maybe the idea of nature – its messy ebbs and flows, its annual race between plant and insect, its unchartable complexity &#8211; is valuable, too. Maybe we’re not sure that whole species should be eradicated because of economic decisions made by a few big companies. Companies last rarely more than fifty years; monarchs and milkweeds, more than fifty thousand. Maybe we’re not certain that genetically modified crops should take over, playing an unknown role in our children’s health.<br>
We can write letters, sign petitions, send money. We can quit using herbicides, take a stand on GM crops. We can plant milkweed, and, for awhile, until the habitat is too diminished to support the population, monarchs will appear. These tawny, airborne jewels will drift across our yards, landing dreamily on our plants as though this place were the only one in the world they want to be.<br>
Which it is.</p>

<p>More news from the rural countryside.<br>
I&#8217;m up here in this little house in seclusion, trying to finish a writing project. It&#8217;s a perfect setting for writing, the landscape around me utterly silent. Woods, fields, stone walls, sky—that&#8217;s it.<br>
This afternoon I took a break and went out to walk the hour-long triangle. I started out past the big elegant Victorian farmhouse just opposite us, heading down the road past the dairy farm. As I walked past the Victorian house I glanced in past the white painted fence. There were some shadows on the other side I hadn&#8217;t expected—I wondered if my neighbours had borrowed some sheep to graze the lawn down? I went closer, and heard an excited honk.</p>

<p>It was not sheep but a herd of energetic pigs, pink and brown and muscular, ears pricked and on the loose. What they were excited about was the garden—the perennial border, to be precise. There were ten of them, and they were hogs with a vision. The vision was of a perennial border without living inhabitants.</p>

<p>It was a lovely sight, if you were a hog—all that rich brown earth churned and rooted and turned up to the sky. If you were a gardener—well, it was a different sort of vision.</p>

<p>I walked down the road to the dairy farm, got in the pickup with the farmer and headed back up the hill with him. We spent the rest of the afternoon herding hogs. I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ll say to the neighbours. A visitation from outer space?</p>

<p>(Op-Ed, The Boston Globe, The International Herald Tribune)</p>

<p>It was shameful, everyone agreed afterwards, that no-one did anything at the time. Because people knew it was happening. There were reports, early on. People saw things, near where it was happening, they knew. Later, they said they hadn’t known, really; they hadn’t understood the scale of it. They explained their reasons for doing nothing. They said the government was responsible, there was nothing they could do. Certainly the government was determined to carry out its plans, and maybe people felt overwhelmed and helpless. Maybe this was a place where the curves of ignorance, courage and survival instinct intersected to exclude the possibility of action. </p>

<p>The affected population knew about it, of course, but they had no political power, no voice. As they diminished in number, they became increasingly less important, which seemed to validate what was happening. How could they be important if they were gone?</p>

<p>Even the people who were distanced from it, and not in danger, knew about it, but they did nothing either. Maybe they didn’t believe what they heard. Maybe they felt it did not threaten them, it was too far away and too terrible. There are things it is too terrible to consider. If you acknowledged their reality, you would be unable to function. And where would we all be, if we couldn’t function? </p>

<p>The news has actually been coming in for decades – from the field, from eyewitnesses, from relief organisations. We can even see the evidence ourselves – it’s happening near us, wherever we are &#8211; but we don’t believe these accounts, even our own. We don’t want to, because they are too terrible to consider. We’re afraid we won’t be able to function. The more tremendous a threat is, the harder it is to comprehend. As Raphael Lemkin said in 1944, “…reports which slip out from behind the frontiers…are very often labelled as untrustworthy atrocity stories, because they are so gruesome that people simply refuse to believe them.” What we’re hearing is too frightening to believe. </p>

<p>The evidence is still growing, and growing worse, but we’re still resisting it. When the scientists grew more serious and more impassioned about the situation, when they began giving numbers, offering proof, asking for action, we decided that we no longer believed in science. We distanced ourselves from the situation; we hoped we wouldn’t be affected. The population at risk is not our population, at least not right now, so we needn’t do anything right now. We might do something later. The government can do something if there’s a real crisis. We trust the government to take care of us, to act responsibly. Believing this is easier than taking drastic steps to stop what’s happening, particularly since this government is very much opposed to stopping it. The government is very much intent on pursuing its present course, which results, as a side-effect &#8211; though the government would not acknowledge this, or even comment on the fact that it is taking place – in the complete destruction of the affected population. The affected population is one half of all the species presently living on earth. </p>

<p>Fanaticism is a driving force here, as it often is behind great crimes. This is a crime against nature, and this fanaticism is economic &#8211; the belief that money and profit should outweigh all other considerations, including survival of the species. If we maintain our current rates of consumption and environmental strategies, by the end of this century, one half the species now alive on earth may be extinct. We don’t know what the specific effects will be, but we know they’ll be extreme. We’re in the middle of a holocaust. We’re presiding over the greatest extermination of living species since the end of the dinosaurs. We’re eliminating habitat, reliable climate, fresh water, clean air, and nourishment. We’re imposing intolerable living conditions on thousands of species. The current rate of extinctions is thought to be at least 1,000 times higher than the natural level. Right now, one quarter of all mammals are endangered with extinction; one third of all species, animal and vegetable, may be gone by 2050. </p>

<p>It may not be evident to us, as we sit in our cubicles, at our laptops, but we need these other species, even those that seem impossibly small and remote. We need the Northern lapwing, the Scottish crossbill, the king protea, (South Africa’s national flower), the albacore tuna, Boyd’s forest dragon (an Australian lizard) – all of which are in dire straits. We’re interconnected to everything. The scrawniest weed in Patagonia absorbs carbon dioxide, which poisons us, and produces oxygen, which we will breathe in New York or Houston. Plants provide air, food and medicine; every living being occupies a niche in the global mosaic. Birds transport seeds and pollen; they destroy insect pests; they clean our harbors and landscapes. All living species perform functions valuable to the ecosystem, to the planet, and to the people who live on it. But species everywhere are being systematically deprived of the possibility of life. </p>

<p>We know what we’re doing. We hear the reports, the gruesome stories, but we’ve decided just to wait and see. We think the scientists – all of them – could be wrong. Maybe we’ll just do nothing. Short-term self-interest suggests that we do nothing right now. Why should we drive slower cars because of the Scottish crossbill? </p>

<p>Cutting fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gases would save many species from vanishing, but we’re not committing ourselves to that strategy. 182 nations ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity; the United States is the only industrial country that refused. We didn’t want to be subject to any regulation over our destruction of the air, the water, the habitat, and the voiceless inhabitants of the earth. Others agree. Many developing countries wanted nothing in the treaty that might limit their freedom to exploit &#8211; and destroy &#8211; their natural resources. So the treaty is neither very powerful or effective, since almost everyone involved places short-term economic goals ahead of the long-term health of the planet. Similar issues affect the Kyoto Agreement. It seems we’re all in this together, this destruction of species. It’s an international effort. </p>

<p>Do we not think we need a healthy planet? Do we think that the animals dying all around us means nothing? That this won’t affect us? Where are the birds, the most common and visible form of wildlife? Intensive agriculture destroys hedges, woods and wetlands that birds need for feeding and nesting; toxic chemicals poison the pests and the seed-bearing wild plants they need for food. Logging destroys whole regions of habitat; industry pollutes air around the globe. The birds can’t build nests, they can’t find food, they can’t feed their young. They’re dying off. Migrating birds used to move in flocks of thousands. Now they straggle through in groups of twenty or thirty. Remember the passenger pigeon? They used to darken the entire sky, across the prairies; we wiped them out in a few decades. We’re watching life being extinguished all around us. </p>

<p>The use of fossil fuels, and the resulting climate change, is wreaking havoc everywhere. Monster storms, temperature spikes and erratic, destructive weather all take their toll on agriculture, construction, transportation and communication, as well as wildlife. Do we still think we don’t belong to the affected population? What if the group we’re destroying turns out to include our own? Don’t we remember the canary in the coal mine? The canaries are dropping like flies. Why are we standing here, holding the cage? </p>

<p>Whom will we believe, if not these scientists – experts in the field – with their gruesome and alarmist facts? How long will we keep denying the evidence?What will we say to our children, and their children, when they learn about the beautiful, rich and varied life on earth that we were privileged to know? The rippling grasses, the graceful trees, the wild birds and animals? How will we explain that we stood by and watched it vanish? What kind of courage do we need, to respond to what’s happening? And this time, there’s no grim controlling overseer to blame. It’s us.</p>

<p>Down by the cove, late afternoon, low tide. This tidal cove is ringed by sea grass, pink granite boulders and dark firs. The cove is small and secluded, with a shallow mud bottom. It’s dead low tide now, but the water is moving. Tidal water is always moving, there is never a moment of stillness, equilibrium. There’s always a tiny trickle of glitter, threading its way across the flats.<br>
The tide has just turned, and the water is slowly filling up the cove, moving in across the flats and forming wide shallow pool. Erratic jets of water shoot up suddenly and sporadically from the mud, in syncopated rhthyms: buried clams, feeling suddenly festive, or greedy, or who knows what.<br>
An osprey comes in, flying low over the water. They like low tide better than high: the prey is visible, and close to the surface. This one flaps up to the top of a dead tree on the far side of the cove. Ospreys flap their wings more often than gulls do. They have shorter necks, and they look down as they fly. This means that gulls, those loud, common scavengers of offal, actually are more stately in flight, with their long necks, high heads, and slow majestic movements.<br>
The osprey (male, I think) settles onto the dead tree at the mouth of the cove. The tree is tall and silvery, stripped of all its bark. It shines in the afternoon light, and it makes a perfect camouflage for the osprey, whose white chest looks into the tree, and whose dark back blends into the dark firs behind him.<br>
The osprey spreads his wings, revealing the pale undersides, showing off. He closes them again and settles down, moving about on his perch. He looks around at the cove, on the alert. He shifts from foot to foot, then suddenly leans forward, raising his tail high and releasing a white liquid ribbon from beneath it, which slides down through the dark air.<br>
The osprey looks about boldly, his head now high. His eyes are fierce and piratical, with low intolerant brows. On his cheek is a black racing stripe. His chest is white, his wings and back mottled black. He lowers his head, reaching down to the branch he’s on. The top of his head is patterned with two white diamonds, side by side, meeting at the middle, surrounded by black. Very elegant, and rather Venetian.<br>
He’s got something there, on the branch, or held in his claws. His head lowers to it, and then his head twists, neatly and precisely, as though he were opening a bottle. He raises his head again, looks around, then lowers it for another neat, ruthless swivel. There’s something at his feet, though it’s too far away to make out – something mauled and bloody. The osprey sits still, lowering his dominoed head for another twist, then raising it again to survey his territory with a fierce stare.<br>
In the cove below, the water moves silently, swirling with the incoming tide, deepening the pools. A huge dragonfly, backlit by the lowering sun, rises suddenly and swiftly over the ater, then wheels, drops again, and vanishes into the glowing, transparent darkness.</p>

<p>One evening I saw something shimmering, down in the cove, and I went down to see who was there. It was a flock of ducks, very busy, paddling around by the little point near us. There were sixteen of them, I think, though it was hard to count, they moved so quickly. They were long and slim, with slightly reddish heads and long flat beaks. There was some blurry white around the neck, and a white patch on the back near the tail. They all seemed to be about the same color &#8211; reddish brown heads and greyish-brown backs. They kept moving, paddling fast, in and out of the little cove, and then went out again into the larger one. The water was very still and glassy, and the pines on the far shore were black, and the ducks were dark against that sheet of silver.<br>
One of them suddenly opened her wings and rose up almost entirely out of the water, and slid rapidly across the surface in a straight line. She moved impossibly fast, and silently. Beneath the surface her feet must have been propelling her, but you could see nothing of that. You could see only the smooth beautiful glide across the silver water &#8211; sleek, elegant, economic. It looked like magic. As she streaked along, the others rose up, one after another, and did the same, gliding swiftly along in the same direction, like a volley of silver bullets, smooth and soundless. At the end of the run they each dove into the green water, as she had, and vanished. A few moments later they were up, then they ducked back under, busy, fast, intent.<br>
It was a training session: a mother and her brood, who look very similar at this time of year. The mother was teaching the juveniles how to dive for their dinners, and the streak across the water was part of a herding operation. The leader rose up, shot fifty feet across the water and then dove rapidly down, to scare the fish. She was herding them, ahead of her, or back toward the babies, I couldn’t see which, but those fish were being harried. The flock spent a lot of time in the small inlet beyond us, where they could corner the schools of fish against the shore. The juveniles ducked and gulped and rose and glided, just as they were being shown to do.<br>
In the natural world there are different methods of teaching survival. Some animal mothers give directions to their offspring, and remonstrate with them – horses and elephants, for example, who usually have only one infant at a time, will do this. Ducks and geese have a different system. Most ducks have big clutches of eggs – ten or twelve. The mother would be exhausted by giving directions and remonstrating with so many offspring: imprinting is used instead. Imprinting is the mysterious process by which newly-hatched ducks and geese will fix their obedient focus onto their mother. (Or whoever is taking care of them. It could be a scientist with a clipboard. ) Once imprinted, a duck will follow docilely behind his mother and imitate everything she does.<br>
These mergansers showed how important imprinting would be. Life in the wild offers no time for correction or directives. If a predator appears, a baby duck can’t wait to be rounded up, or told where to go &#8211; he must do exactly as his mother does, at once. What the ducks were doing was imitation for survival, and it was working perfectly. The younger ducks were mimicking their mother &#8211; the smooth glides across the water, the sudden deep dives into the flurry of fish. This, the mother showed, with each fluid movement, is how you live.<br>
A week later they were back.<br>
The tide was very high, covering the long soft grasses along the shore. The water was calm and silvery again, and the pines were darkening across the cove. The ducks, though, were different. Now they all seemed the same size, in just a week the juveniles seemed adult. They were no longer given the benefit of herding. No-one rose up and made the long glittering glide. Instead they moved smoothly along in the water, fast and efficient, making long black lines against the silver, ducking their heads, diving silently, then reappearing.<br>
There were two fewer, as far as I could tell. Maybe two of them were in a different cove, with a different group, or maybe something else had happened. But fourteen of them were still together, still part of that rapid, silent flock, each of them moving in strong straight lines against the quiet, darkening water.</p>

<p>September seems to be the time for frogs in the garden. All along the stone walls, in the Brick Path garden(1), there are little dark green leopard frogs, spotted with brown , and with two handsome gold lines down their backs. When I come near, these hop importantly out of the way, into the tangle of collapsing plants at the back of the beds. I like having them in the garden – they eat bugs – but there’s no way of letting them know that.</p>

<p>The best frog, though, this year, is an extremely small tree frog that has made his home on the Zephyrine Drouhin. This is the incredibly generous and forgiving rose-colored climber on the porch wall. It’s an awful spot, roots cramped between the porch foundations and the cellar door, on a wall that definitely faces north, but this rose, may her tribes increase, doesn’t seem to mind. This year she has sent a long, graceful shoot diagonally up the trellis, about ten feet long. A few days ago I examined her leaves, some of which were laced by a caterpillar, and I saw the tiny frog.</p>

<p>He’s small enough to fit very comfortably sideways on a rose leaf, and he sits with his front feet tucked neatly underneath him, as though he were carrying a muff. He’s a very pale greenish tan, nearly translucent, with dark eyes, each with a short dark stripe that goes directly through it. On his back is a vague dim pattern, like drowned islands seen from above. The first time, not knowing he was there, I scared him, and I watched him leap seven or eight inches – seven or eight times his length – to another leaf, stretching out his strange rubbery extra-terrestrial fingers and toes to clutch the next perch. I leaned down to look at him, and then he sat motionless, the fingers hidden beneath his belly, his dark striped eyes open, and his pale throat palpitating, very fast, a quick hurrying rhythm of pulse.</p>

<p>I watched him for a long time, to see if the rythym would slow when he was less alarmed, but watching a wild animal is like the physics principle (Heidegger’s?) : by watching them you change them, so I’ve never found out whether or not the pulse would slow.</p>

<p>He’s been there, somewhere on the rose trellis, each day when I come out, though sometimes it takes a little while to find him. Yesterday he was on the trellis itself, sitting completely still and composed, clamped ont o the perpendicular surface, his pale head facing straight up, the drowned islands on his back, his bright unnatural eyes slightly lidded.<br>
I couldn’t see the pulse.</p>

<p>Along the eastern edge of the meadow here I put in clumps of beautiful dark red beebalm, the native monarda. They’re upright plants, with tall stalks and dense moppy heads. In July and August these glow against the dark shadowy woods beyond.<br>
I planted them for the hummingbirds. Hummingbirds love red flowers, and I love hummingbirds. We have native red beebalm, the red and pink native honeysuckle, lonicera, and the native trumpet vine, campsis radicans, though this takes ten years to bloom, we learned after planting it. We put it in seven years ago, and so far it has busily covered the walls of the garage in a thick green tapestry, but no more. It seems to be holding out for the decade.<br>
My bird book describes the hummingbird family – Trochilidae – as the smallest birds. The only ones we get here in Maine are ruby-throated hummingbirds, Archilochus colubris. A learned friend told me that Archilocus was a Roman soldier famous for his retreats, during battle: apparently the hummingbird is the only bird who can fly backwards.<br>
The shining blur of wings rotates in both directions. My learned friend told me, too, about sitting on a screened-in porch one afternoon, reading, when he heard the sound of a sudden small collision. He looked up to see a hummingbird, his long tiny beak stuck fast in the screen. He was momentarily impaled, the delicate proboscis caught in the minute metal grid. But it was only for a moment: the bird’s wings began to blur again, and he hummed rapidly backwards like the Roman and was gone. (The Archilocus incident explains those tiny mysterious gaps that appear in metal screens. I’d always wondered what produced them – very powerful mosquitoes, muscling their way inside?)<br>
My bird book also describes the hummingbirds as “pugnacious,” and though it saddens me to say this about a friend, they are. They are ferocious. I will also admit, caught up by candor, that most of the ones I see around here are not males but females – throats a dull green, not ruby. It’s the females that fight. They are Amazons, fierce warrior queens with volcanic tempers and belligerent manners.<br>
One afternoon I watched a hummer moving from blossom to blossom among the sorberias along the fence by the house. These graceful shrubs have long white plumy blossoms and lacy green leaves. It was a pretty sight, the tiny bird poised and motionless in the air, regal, perfectly erect, her wings shimmering magically, her green back glittering and iridescent. Focused and intent, her movements mysteriously abrupt, she moved from white plume to white plume. As she hovered and rose and dropped and hovered, I became aware of a noise, and of motion nearby. There was a tiny, shrill, “Chick, chick, chick,” and something swirled in the air over her. It was another hummer, small as a green bee, moving in sweeping arcs over the first bird’s head, each arc lower than the one before. She swooped over the head of the feeding bird, the arc dropping with each swing, like th ominous sweep of an executioner’s axe. “Chick, chick, chick,” she shrieked homicidally. The first bird slid sideways; she vibrated back and forth in alarm; finally she ducked under a wide branch of sorberia. She hovered there, assaulted by the wild cries of the invader, until she rose suddenly and zoomed off into the open spaces of the meadow, and she was gone.<br>
They do this all the time.<br>
They must have something else to do in the mornings, somewhere else to be, but in the late afternoons I find them at the edge of the meadow, by the beebalm. There’s a birch tree next to one stand of flowers, and a big mass of bay bushes behind it. The hummingbirds zoom in and out of the flowers, perching, suddenly still, on a branch, then shifting into motion again, as though they were casting a quick magic spell on themselves. They rise up among the flowers, heads raised, beaks poised, wings invisible. Then a new one arrives, instantly outraged, and they zoom at each other, buzzing furiously. They pursue each other at high speeds, from beebalm stand to beebalm stand. “Chick, chick, chick!” they scream, in high, tiny voices, wild with fury. They’re always in a state, those microscopic hearts always beating a frenzied tattoo of rage, faster than we can imagine.<br>
Once last year I was standing on the porch, watching a hummingbird feeding on the tall plume poppies next to the fort door. He hung in midair among them, probing each flower delicately with his beak, his wings shimmering in the sunlight. I stood nearby, watching. Finishing, he moved on, from the flowers toward me. He hung in the air in front of my face, shifting slightly, a bright iridescent shimmer in the air. He was very close, no more than two feet from my face, and his bold dark gaze was fixed on me. Under his long fierce stare I began to feel odd, then faintly uneasy, as though this tiny, satiny feathered thing might contain – what? some threat? I stepped back instinctively. He peered at me a second longer, made an avian executive decision, then sped away. It wasn’t until I went back inside, past the mirror in the front hall, that I realised how I looked to a hummingbird: the frames of my glasses are bight red. In the dim light of the porch, it must hav seemed interestingly like two red rims of blossom. It was a flower he didn’t know, but one possibly worth investigating, worth piercing with his long pointed bill, drilling into it as though it were a metal screen. When the blossoms retreated nervously into the darkness he lost interest, though, and hummed swiftly off into the sunlight, looking for other realms to conquer. Much as I love hummingbirds, I was just as glad not to have gotten to know that particular one any better.<br>
I still love them, though. I like having them around. I like finding them, in the late afternoons, perching among the beebalms, waiting for a fight to get into.</p>

<p>It’s just after sundown, and cold. The sky is perfectly clear, the air crystalline.<br>
The tide is running out, and below the pebble beach the waves come lapping in, darkening the long sloping granite ledges. Sutton’s Island is a dim outline in the dusk. Close offshore, half a dozen ducks are rafting together for the night. It doesn’t look very comfortable or warm out there – it’s just below freezing – but the ducks, silhouetted against the pale water, form a ragged, close line, and rock peacefully as the waves follow each other in.<br>
On the western side of the cove it’s sunset, all reds and fiery hues. Out at the point, the water meets a line of firs, densely black against the rose-colored sky. The sky is fiere and brilliant along the treetops, fading upward to paler hues. The water below it is glimmering red, softening to pink toward the east. The sky and water here are awash with sunset. They’ve been taken over by it, flooded by the great roseate streams of light.<br>
On the eastern side of the cove, it’s night. The water here is silky black, and the entire curtain of sky has turned a deep endless mauve-gray. Halfway up the sky is half a moon, brilliant and huge. It’s never been so huge. It’s enormous, and radiant with a cold white light. Sometimes half a moon looks like its own shape, a sickle, or a crescent, but this like a full moon cut in half, a demisphere. The absent, darkened side of it is mysteriously present, felt, though not visible. Half of it’s lit up as though with a spotlight. All the markings are visible, and bold: there are the craters and mountains that we’ve always known, the lakes and valleys, all the mysterious lunar runes that have been in our nighttime minds for a million years.<br>
Below this bright presence, on the black water, lies its rippling reflection, brilliant points of light, incandescent. A blanket of gleaming scintillae, rocking like the ducks on the lowering tide.<br>
Strange that all of it – the rose-colored streams of light on the waves, the flaming sky behind the firs, the shocking cold brilliance of the half-moon, the glittering net on the inky water below – all of this is radiance borrowed from the vanished sun, which has gone, which has sunk soundlessly below the horizon, which has disappeared beyond the edge of the known world.</p>

<p>It’s still cold, and in the late afternoons, when I go running, I’m still in my parka. The air is clean and chill, and I can see my breath. The woods, on either side of the road, are still brown and grey. Nothing is green. Spring is keeping herself dar – though I know she’s around: the bare grey branches are full of birdsong. The red-winged blackbirs have arrived, with their lovely liquid purling trills, and last week I saw a flock of robins in the field.</p>

<p>Down the road there’s a small pond – just a widening of the stream, really – a sheet of dark water, with a bottom of dead leaves. The pair of mallards is back, and every afternoon I see them busy there, the trim patterns of their feathers rich against the smooth water. They duck their heads into it, paddling about, feeding on something. I can taste the water: cold and clear and woodsy.</p>

<p>There’s something else, though, further evidence. In the boggy parts along the road, where the hillside starts to fall away into the woods, the aliens have arrived. Rising slowly from the dead browns of last year’s foliage are motionless spirals of leaves, twisting up through the swampy ground like unearthly corkscrews.</p>

<p>Why are spotted things so strange, so sinister? These leaves are otherworldly and alarming. They’re mottled and striped; they’re rotten-brown, electric-green, birthmark-purple, bruise-yellow. The flecks and spots are everywhere, tiny and dark, myriad and ominous, like insects. The leaves are wide and fleshy and tortuous. They curl, writhing slowly around their own thick center, roiling upwards to a sharp pointed tip: it’s the lowly and fabulous skunk cabbage.</p>

<p>First plant of the season, spring’s handwritten anouncement. Everything surrounding it is old, dry, cast-off, dead, but this doesn’t matter. These strange, spotted, twisted leaves have appeared again – rising up from the wintry earth, potent, vivid, thick with life, reminding us that there’s a lot we don’t know, theat beauty is more varied and foreign than we remembered – and so has spring.</p>

<p>It’s cold here, still. In the evenings I still go running in my parka. The air is clean and chill; I can see my breath. The woods on either side of the dirt road are still brown and grey. Nothing is green. Spring is keeping herself dark – though I know she’s around: the bare grey branches are full of birdsong. The red-winged blackbirds have arrived, with their liquid warbling calls, and a huge flock of robins were busy in the hillside meadow last week.</p>

<p>Down the road there’s a small pond. It’s just a widening of the stream, really – a narrow sheet of clear black water, with a bottom of dead leaves. The pair of mallards is back, and every afternoon I see them in the dark water, ducking their heads into it, paddling about in the current. I can taste it: cold and pure and woodsy. They’re getting ready to nest.</p>

<p>But that’s not all. In the boggy parts, where the hillside drops down from the road, the aliens have arrived. Rising slowly up from the dead browns of last year’s grasses are motionless spirals of leaves, twisting upward through the swampy ground like corkscrews.</p>

<p>Op-Ed, The Boston Globe</p>

<p>January, and twenty seven degrees. Down in the cove the water is emerald green, as though it were midsummer, but we know it’s not. In the garden , the shallow puddles from the last rain are frozen solid. We’ve had some mild weather lately, but now it’s over: the air tastes like iron, and the sky is low and grey. Snow is imminent. We’re all waiting for it.<br>
The garden is ready, everything in it has been cut down clean. Only one clump of tall grasses is still standing, its pale dry stalks whispering and rustling in the wind. Everything else is gone, down to the ground. The short clipped stems are covered with pine boughs. The garden is bare, waiting for snow.<br>
Also waiting for it is the snowshoe hare who’s sitting inside the walled garden, against the concrete base of the house. During the summer, he might easily be invisible there, at the back of the deep beds, shielded by the heavy foliage, the big curved hosta leaves, the dense clumps of ferns. He might be invisible there right now, if it were a little earlier, or later. But right at this moment he couldn’t be more glaringly visible, because he’s made the big mistake, not only of taking shelter against a bare wall, in a flat empty garden, but of disguising himself as a snowbank, in a brown landscape.<br>
The snowshoe hare (lepus americanus) has a system that’s exquisitely attuned to lowering temperatures, diminishing light, and the arrival of winter. Some time in the late fall this hare’s summer-brown coat very sensibly turned white (it’s not his fault we have no snow). Hares don’t dig burrows, and in the winter, a hare may shelter beneath a log, or in the tunnels made by heavy brush covered with snow. But often he will snug himself up against something solid: a tree, a bank, a log, a weather break. Exposed in the open like that, a brown coat against a white field would be a dead giveaway. So, somewhere along the evolutionary time-line of lepus americanus, an ingenious color change system developed, for survival &#8211; the shaft of each hair changes, seasonally, from brown to white, and back again.<br>
Our wall seems to be a safe place for this one. It’s sheltered by the surrounding fences, and it’s quiet. The hare sits completely still, against the concrete, as calm and secure as though his bold white coat blended perfectly with its scumbly brown surface. He’s near the front door, and we go in and out, peering discreetly at him.<br>
Our hare sits bunched in a neat rounded dome, the curve of his back high. I expected a hare to be long and low, but he is short and plump, like a teapot. His dark rounded eyes are brown, with a faint tinge of red. His front paws, just visible beneath his snowy chest, are oddly brown, as though he’s got on someone else’s shoes. His narrow ears are velvet brown, and there is the sheen of the shadowy brown undercoat, beneath his snowy overcoat. His nose, too, is a blotch of neutral brown, and there are a few vague streaks of it on his shoulders: the broken lines of camouflage. He’s watching, his dark eye is on me, but he is completely, utterly, still, despite our comings and goings. His ears are tilted slightly up – he’s listening – but they don’t swivel: movement would give him away. Immobility is his protection, it’s movement that draws the eye. His stillness says simply that he’s not here; there’s nothing here.<br>
His color-coding, too, is part of the hare’s survival strategy. But this weather is dangerous for him: he can’t adapt to unseasonal fluctuations, he can’t change color every time the temperature rises in January. The snowshoe hare, like most living organisms, has evolved over time in relation to a reliable weather cycle. Living things rely on a dependable climate, whether it’s temperate, desert or arctic. Deciduous trees, for example, cannot tolerate an early, unseasonal snowfall, while they still have their leaves. The weight of the snow on the leaves is too heavy for their branches to sustain, and they’ll break. The loss of large branches will compromise the tree’s health. Fruit trees, which flower in the spring, require calm, mild spring weather during their blossoming season. Bees won’t fly in high winds, which will rip the blossoms off the trees, so the chance for pollination – and a fruit harvest – will be lost. Warm weather in the middle of winter acts as a signal for plants to use their stored energy and send it upward, producing tender green shoots. A subsequent freeze will kill the shoots, and the plant will need to muster the energy to start over again, later. The energy spent on the winter shoot was wasted. The second or third try may produce a plant that’s small and stunted. Energy is the elixir of life in the natural world; no organism can afford to waste it. Successful survival strategies don’t include false starts.<br>
Unseasonal storms and temperatures put stress on agriculture and fruticulture and silviculture, as well as on wildlife, and plants and animals under stress have a higher risk for disease and infestation. Historically, there have always been unseasonal weather events, but historically they were unusual – that’s why they were recorded. They weren’t the norm.<br>
The emission of greenhouse gases disrupts the layer of atmosphere in which weather patterns are formed. Increasingly, we’re evolving a pattern of unreliable weather, one of unseasonal fluctuations, extreme storms, droughts and floods that threaten the vigor, reproduction and survival of plants and animals.<br>
Our snowshoe hare waits, motionless, against the wall. If it snows again, as it normally would in January, he’ll have protective cover, and the chances will diminish of his being seen by the coyote who trots past, down by the cove, along the shoreline, in the late afternoons. But if we have another winter of fluctuating weather, alternating between hard freezing and unseasonal warmth, the snowshoe hare – and all the trees on the property – and on the island – and in the state &#8211; will be in trouble.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always liked possums, mostly I think for their strangeness &#8211; they&#8217;re the only marsupials around here &#8211; and their gentleness &#8211; they&#8217;re the only conscientious objectors in the animal world I can think of. They don&#8217;t bite, and won&#8217;t attack you. All they do to defend themselves is to feign death.<br>
Once I was up in the big field along the top of our hill with my dog, and I saw her stop suddenly and lean down into the grass, quickly and with great purpose. Before I could reach her, she had grabbed a possum by the neck and shook it hard. When I got to my dog I grabbed her by the neck and shook her hard. I made her drop the poor possum, whose neck had been broken. It lay curled and motionless where it had been thrown in the grass. I leaned down and put my open hand on its side, feeling its soft, furred, still warm body. It didn&#8217;t move, though some dying reflex made the lips draw slightly back over the tiny child&#8217;s teeth.<br>
Furious, I scolded my dog for such wanton killing, but she only wagged her tail blithely. I took her back to the house for incarceration and then I went back, alone, to mourn the corpse. It was gone, of course.<br>
Possums are, I think, one of the Seven Sleepers, but they&#8217;re waking up early this year. Two weeks ago, I sat in the kitchen having breakfast and looked up to see a possum wallowing across the snow, from the forsythia bushes to back behind the garage where the compost heap is. He was unhurried, his small lumpy body trundling steadily along with a soft boneless gait. His eyes were ringed with dark, and his long hairless tail stood out against the snow.<br>
Last night, leaving my study over the garage around nine, my dog stopped in the tiny vestibule between inner door and outer, where I keep the big bucket of bird seed. My dog had a sudden urgent desire to look inside it, so I did as well. We both leaned over it and there, curled up on top of the Best Songbird Assortment, was the possum.<br>
I took my dog and put her behind the door to the study, and went back to observe. The possum was motionless, waiting. I gently tipped the bucket down, so he&#8217;d be able to get out, but he stayed where he was. I leaned over then and we stared for a long time at each other: that vivid, feral face.<br>
His bright dark eyes were ringed with brown, and his small pointed snout was bare and pink, like a tiny pig&#8217;s, and still covered with tiny seeds. His brownish-grey coat was soft and fluffy, like thistle-down. His tail was thick and pink and hairless, quite terrible, like a medical hose. I could see the tiny white teeth, but he wasn&#8217;t snarling. He was entirely still, even his breathing was quiet. But he was wild; even in his quietness he was wild. Everything in him was waiting for the next thing I did.<br>
What I did was watch. I wanted to memorise him there, curled around himself in that bucket like a muff, the thick pink curved tail, the tiny clawlike toes spread out over the birdseed.<br>
For a long time we faced each other, and then I left him, taking the dog, turning out the light and opening the door so that he could leave. When I came back later, the tipped-over bucket was empty. The possum had gone back to wherever he lives, full of sunflower seeds.</p>

<p>Crows are a big presence around here, and very handsome if you like gangsters. Sleek, black and glossy, they hang around up in the field, walking bossily around, having meetings, boasting and arguing and planning what nests to rob. I prefer songbirds, but it’s not as though I have a choice: the crows are here. And I have to admire their elegant black silhouettes, their slow arrogant wingflaps. Whenever I scatter scraps out in the field, or on the lawn, the crows are there within minutes, teetering heavily on a low branch, flapping ponderously down, snatching the prize, then flapping slowly off with it. The songbirds wait meekly in the forsythia bushes until the crows are done.</p>

<p>Right now, at eight degrees, with six inches of frozen snow on the ground, I can’t put anything out for the smaller birds, because I have staying with me my daughter’s cat &#8211; a sweet-tempered amiable creature indoors, but outdoors a stealthy serial killer. So the birdfeeder hangs empty in the crabapple tree, and the chickadees swing mournfully by to see if some miracle has filled it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I decided to foil the cat and feed the birds. Up in the field I spread out a whole bagfull of birdseed, a long looping line of it scattered on the frozen snow, out in the middle of the hillside – a white wasteland where a brown-and-black tabby cat could never hide. I went back to the house and the crows came at once, settling officiously down and stalking about, spearing sunflower seeds and telling each other what they were doing.</p>

<p>The songbirds hung about in the bushes, surprisingly timid, and then I began to realise what I had done. I’d asked them to light on a flat and completely exposed place, with nowhere for them to hide: it was a red-tailed hawk’s dream. But there was nothing I could do about it then, the seed was already out, spread across the snow. I watched from inside as the small birds – titmice, chickadees, juncos, the pair of nervous cardinals – began to pluck up their courage. They began making daring forays, finally settling down in the snow to peck at the seed.</p>

<p>And sure enough, to my alarm, I saw suddenly against the snowy sky the pale tail feathers of the silent raptor, swirling down in murderous descent toward the small unwitting bodies – and then I saw the tailfeathers go swirling right back up again, harried and hounded by the resident squadron of glossy black gangsters.<br>
Not a songbird lost.</p>

<p>The snow has silenced the landscape. Nothing moves today in this white forest. The birds are mysteriously absent.<br>
Even the cove itself – though certainly the tide still sweeps its waters in and out – seems motionless. Its shoreline is roughly piled with snow, and the inner half of the cove is frozen, a solid stretch of churned-up snow and cakes of ice. Out beyond this, the water is dark and gray with drifting, translucent ice, granular and amorphous.<br>
There’s no movement here, in the woods, or in the underbrush. The long-legged snowshoe hare that was hopping through the woods last week, looking foolish because he’d turned white too soon, is now invisible. He may be curled up somewhere, inside a hollow log, or he may be moving subtly through this pale wintry landscape, impossible to see.<br>
The trees going down to the cove are all evergreens, mostly firs, and right now they’re loaded with 14 inches of snow. Their boughs slant steeply down under this burden, but they don’t break. On the few times when a heavy snow falls early in the season, while the deciduous trees are still in leaf, a natural disaster occurs. Those leaves, wide and flat, hold the snow in accumulating piles, and those branches, horizontal and rigid, are unprepared for this cumbersome burden. They break off with excruciating cracks, and fall heavily and heartbreakingly onto the lawn.<br>
Many times, in one of these snows, I’ve climbed out onto the roof with a broom and whacked off all the snow I could reach, but I couldn’t reach every limb, and all around me I’d hear the big old sugar maples creaking and groaning, and their limbs would finally crack right off with the unbearable heaviness of snow. We’ve lost big branches that way, from the sugar maples and the ash trees. But not from the conifers.<br>
A fir tree is an engineer’s dream, perfectly designed for shedding snow. Every aspect works to this end: the tapering, pyramidal shape, the pointed tip, the drooping branches, the fine, downward-slanting needles. Snow, no matter how wet or heavy, slides easily off. It’s shed at once from the highest, most flexible twigs, then it slides father, until it rests in bulky drifts along a lower branch.<br>
The branch already droops downward, and it’s limber, ready to give. The more snow, the more its weight bears the branch down, until the angle is so steep that gravity intervenes. The snow slides down farther, out onto the narrowest, supplest, slenderest needles fingers. These yield gracefully, under its weight, and the snow drops off. The branch, released, rises springily upward; a silent plume of snowy mist blooms in the air.<br>
That’s all that’s happening here this afternoon, in the woods around the silent cove. There’s no wind. The surface of the snow is untouched, as though there were no hares, foxes, squirrels, crows or chickadees here. The snow, weighty and commanding, seems to muffle activity, as though the creatures are attending to its presence, lying low beneath this heavy, unfamiliar white blanket.<br>
There are no footprints yet. The only marks are the erratic, soft-edged craters made by the suddenly plummeting snow. The only movement is the white spume, spilling silently from a dark, laden bough.</p>

<p>May 1997<br>
This morning, as soon as I got up, I went outside with the dogs. I wanted to see what had happened to the garden since I had last seen it. That had been only twelve hours earlier, but in the spring the garden is an astonishing place, and each day it must be examined for revelations.<br>
It was around seven o&#8217;clock when we walked up the path through the meadow to the pool. The grass was heavy and wet, and the shadows long. The light was pale and thrilling, and it streamed across the meadow in great horizontal sheets. At the top of the hill I opened the gate and stepped inside the fence. Beneath the high filigree shade of the ash trees, the blue water of the pool shimmered coolly in the early morning air. The pool is square, with a wide flat edge of bluestone, and on the far side, standing quietly on the stone edging, stood a young wild duck. She was in brown tweed, trim and very chic. There was a dark narrow stripe leading from her eye, and a horizontal blue band across her wing. As we came through the gate she stood poised and still, attentive.<br>
At first the dogs paid no attention to her, and I walked quietly toward her. When I reached the near edge of the pool, the duck, with economy and aplomb, settled into the water. She glided swiftly into the center of the pool, where she stayed, regally treading water. I knew both that she was a lady duck and that she was very young because, on the flat stone edge of the pool where she had been standing, looking slightly haphazard, was a single pale egg.<br>
Seeing the duck surging through the ripples, the dogs became excited. They are Standard Poodles, which are water retrievers. This scene &#8211; Bird on Water &#8211; now meant something to them. The older one, Milly, turned disingenuously coy, and capered to the far side of the pool. The duck gave an anxious squack and swivelled, heading back toward me. Milly turned, too, and the duck stopped and squacked again, no visibly fearful. The pool is not large, and the duck had just understood that she was not safe in it, even in the very center of the water. I held the other dog, Lacey, beside me, and sternly called Milly. Milly frisked over, prancing, pretending that this was a game. Of course it was not a game; dogs will kill ducks if they can. I held them while I thought of what to do. The duck had made a mistake, coming here. She was in danger; she had to leave.<br>
I couldn&#8217;t bear for her to leave. She was beautiful, and her dark wild presence did us honor. She had chosen us, our quiet pool at the edge of the woods. Her appearance seemed like a miraculous visitation. It was a fortunate event, like the apparition of a god. I loved having her there, moving across our shimmering blue, her sleek silhouette quick and vivid. I loved seeing her standing, quiet and composed, on the bluestone in the early slanting light.<br>
She had to leave. She was wild, we were not. The chasm between us was bottomless, her error in judgment was infinite in its consequences. Bare bluestone is not a nest, a swimming pool is not a pond. I pictured the ducklings in a ragged line, careening desperately after their mother, dodging the pull from the filter, fighting over grass clippings and drowned worms, fleeing from the dogs. She had to leave.<br>
Holding the dogs, I walked around the pool. I had never seen a wild duck egg before, and I crouched before it. It lay whole and perfect, its ovate curve surreally smooth against the rough texture of the stone. It was animate but motionless, charged still. It seemed larger than a hen&#8217;s egg, and fatter, less tapered. Its color was strange, unearthly, a pale, livid grey, the sky before dawn. I touched it: faintly damp, oddly warm. The duck watched me steadily, swimming in a tiny circle in the center of the pool. Her dark silhouette was clear against the wavering blue of the water.<br>
&#8220;You can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t safe.&#8221; I picked up the egg.<br>
Head high, the duck eyed me, treading water. Her eye was bright and black.<br>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; I said.<br>
Keeping the dogs close, I began to retreat across the lawn, still watching her. I felt like a criminal. From the center of the water she watched me go.<br>
In the kitchen I set the egg down on the butcher block counter. Its pale oblong shape rolled slightly, then stopped. I thought of the mother, silently watching me pick up the egg. Up there by the pooll, beneath the high branches of the ash trees, I had told myself that I was being responsible, unsentimental. Nature is ruthless, unsentimental. I knew that. Up there I had some idea of the law of the jungle, that I was being cruel to be kind. Now, inside the safe white walls of my kitchen, I felt only cruel. What was I doing with this wild duck egg on my counter, still warm from its mother&#8217;s downy feathers?<br>
But what should I have done instead? If I had frightened the duck away from the pool she would have abandoned the egg. She couldn&#8217;t have carried it to a safe place, and the dogs would have eaten it in savage gulps, leaving pale fragments of the shell scattered messily on the grass, like vandalism. Should I have kept it from the dogs and thrown the egg into the trash? Put it on the compost pile for the raccoons? Those seemed insults. At least this way I was honoring the egg. I was celebrating its excellence. I felt like a cannibal.<br>
The shell was tough, and hard to crack. When it finally parted, the egg was mostly yolk, a deep glowing orangey-yellow. Suspended in its thick transparent aura, it slid into the bowl, slow and viscous. I beat at it with a fork, churning the yolk and the translucent casing into a pale froth. I poured it, foamy, into a hot iron skillet. At once the edges frilled and bubbled, the transparent mizture clouded, dulled. The froth turned opaque, formed clumps, turned thick and solid. I slid it onto a plate and ate it standing up, feeling strange. Its flavour was rich and exotic, faintly gamey, heavy with guilt. Was I respectfully paying tribute or wolfishly enjoying the spoils? With each mouthful I apologised silently to the duck, who had chosen my place among all others, who had trusted me with her most valuable accomplishment.<br>
Much later, I went back up to the pool. The sun was high now in the ash trees, and the light was ordinary, pallid and diffuse. The grass was dry underfoot. At the top of the hill I kept the dogs behind me and opened the gate. I moved quietly, hoping &#8211; for what? Hoping to see her there again, of course. Hoping to find her silent elegant presence &#8211; quick, vivid &#8211; in our small blue pool.<br>
But the duck, with her sleek compact form, her grave black eyes, was gone. My plan had been successful. I had taught her what we were like. The blue water shimmered in the sunlight, empty.</p>
