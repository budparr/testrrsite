    <p>Adele had had a bad night. She had gone to sleep around midnight, in her parents&#8217; guest room, but she had waked again at two-fifteen. From then to four-thirty she had lain awake in the blond Swedish bed her uncle had given her mother when he got rid of all his Swedish modern furniture. The bed looked odd in this room, which was painted lavender and filled with Victorian mahogany furniture from Adele&#8217;s grandparents. But Adele&#8217;s mother, Cynthia, did not like getting rid of things, so the bed stayed, with a length of lavender cotton draped over its hard wooden headboard as a sort of temporary disguise. It had been like that for twenty-two years.</p>

<p>At four-thirty Adele gave up and took a mild sleeping pill, so that when she finally woke again for the day she was groggy and it was already late. She could hear her parents, keeping their voices down for her sake, but already started in on the days&#8217; arguments. Her father, Sam, was downstairs in the kitchen, and Cynthia, was on the way down after him. The house was small, and Adele could hear Cynthia climbing slowly onto the electric chair that shuttled up and down the staircase. It had been originally installed for Cynthia, ten years ago, when her ankle began to give out, but now that Sam had had a hip replacement they both used it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already called him,&#8221; Cynthia said in a low, strained voice, trying to make her words carry to the kitchen on the next floor without waking Adele in the next room. &#8220;I just think we should see if there&#8217;s too much in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; Sam called out from the kitchen. His voice was loud and antagonistic. Adele could hear the stair-chair arms clicking into place as Cynthia settled herself into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; Sam shouted again, still louder, and impatient.</p>

<p>Adele heard the click of the switch, and then the low masterful hum of the stair-chair as her mother began to descend.<br>
&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; Sam called for the third time, his voice full of exasperation.</p>

<p>At the bottom, the Stair-chair stopped, and the arms clunked heavily again as Cynthia climbed out. Adele heard her uneven steps as she began walking toward the kitchen. She spoke when she got close enough so that she didn&#8217;t have to yelll, but her voice was now exasperated. She spoke so slowly as to be almost insulting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; Cynthia said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s too much food in the refrigerator, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s making that noise. I&#8217;ve called the repair man, but before he makes a special trip I want to take some of the things out to see if that&#8217;s what&#8217;s causing it.&#8221;<br>
Adele sat up in bed. Since her father&#8217;s hip replacement, a group of neighbours had kindly been bringing dinners to her parents, night after night, for weeks. Sam and Cynthia were grateful, but Cynthia was feeling oppressed by the quantity of the food. Neither she nor Sam ate much, and the refrigerator was now crammed with plastic boxes half-covered with foil, small plates of dried-up carrot sticks, aluminum pans with small amounts of gelid spaghetti in the corners. Cynthia wanted neither to throw anything out nor to eat it.</p>

<p>Adele, who now lived in New York, had come down the night before to take her parents out to dinner for their anniversary. When she heard them downstairs arguing she began to get up, exasperated by her mother&#8217;s beliefs.</p>

<p>When she came downstairs her mother was sitting in her long pink bathrobe by the telephone. Her long wispy hair was pulled back to a fraying bun. Sam, in bathrobe and slippers, was standing at the refrigerator. Six cartons of milk stood on the table. He was lifting a jar of mayonnaise from the refrigerator, and frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just see what happens,&#8221; Cynthia said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; Adele said, coming in to the room, already annoyed, &#8220;the refrigerator doesn&#8217;t get overstrained because you have a lot of leftover food in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of her parents answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The refrigerator just keeps a particular space cold,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;A certain cubic area &#8221; she was proud of coming up with cubic &#8211; &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how much stuff is in it.&#8221; She wondered if this were true. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difference to the refrigerator. Unless you put hot things in it, a casserole right from the oven, or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Putting things in the refrigerator from the oven?&#8221; Sam turned and stared challengingly at Adele. His white hair stood straight up at the crown of his head. He was wrinkled cotton pajamas, and a handsome Black Watch plaid bathrobe that Adele had given him for Christmas.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you did,&#8221; Adele said, aware that she had allowed a dangerous digression into her argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would we put things into the refrigerator from the oven?&#8221; Sam asked. He sounded disgusted and cross, as though Adele had accused him of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; Adele said, &#8220;that your refrigerator isn&#8217;t making a noise because of what&#8217;s in it.&#8221; She paused. The refrigerator was not, as far as she could tell, making any unusual noise at all. It was humming innocuously. They all listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just put them on the table,&#8221; Cynthia said to Sam.</p>

<p>Sam put the mayonnaise jar next to the milk cartons. Adele leaned over and looked at the dates on the milk cartons. There were six of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, half of these are already out-dated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you want me to throw them out for you? That way &#8211; &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, just let me take care of the milk cartons,&#8221; Sam said in a patronizing way. He was the one who drank milk. &#8220;I keep track of these things pretty closely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adele looked at Cynthia, who rocked slightly in her chair and said nothing. &#8220;So the repairman is coming?&#8221; Adele asked.</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded. &#8220;I called him. I don&#8217;t know when he&#8217;s coming, but I called him. But it may be all those milk cartons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s the noise?&#8221; Adele asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hear any noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was making a loud noise, earlier,&#8221; Cynthia said determinedly. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I called the repairman to see if he&#8217;d come and take a look at it. He&#8217;s the one who fixed the heater in your father&#8217;s study.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t broken,&#8221; Sam said in a triumphant undertone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, made it work again,&#8221; Cynthia said.</p>

<p>Adele looked at the long table, one end of which was covered with half-full milk cartons. The mayonnaise jar was in the middle of her place mat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to have some breakfast,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can I fix anything for either of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already made my breakfast,&#8221; Sam said. &#8220;Your mother&#8217;s not hungry. Like some toast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want anything, mother?&#8221; Adele asked. Her mother was tiny and fragile, her bones birdlike, her hair wispy. She was evaporating before their eyes. Cynthia was eighty-seven, Sam ninety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love some toast, thanks, Daddy,&#8221; Adele said. The kitchen was small and square, and most of it was taken up by the long pine table. The far end, by the telephone, was loaded with mail and catalouges. The near end, by the sink and refrigerator, was where they ate, and now mostly loaded with the warming milk cartons. On the wall by the stove was a tiny tin cupboard crammed with half-full jars of ancient food. &#8220;Do you have any decaf coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Cynthia said. &#8220;I try to keep everything my children want. I think it&#8217;s in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the cupboard was a small ancient jar of decaffeinated coffee, with a green label and green top. On it was a grubby post-it label, with Cynthia&#8217;s handwriting. &#8220;De-caff&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>Adele got out plates and silver to set the table, though there was little space to set the china beside the giant stand of out-dated milk cartons. Her toast came up, and Sam took it out and put it on her plate. He sat down with his boiled egg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want a piece, mother?&#8221; Adele asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ll butter it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe I&#8217;ll have a half,&#8221; Cynthia said, and rose carefully from the rocker. The two of them sat at the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want me to,&#8221; said Adele, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go through all those things in the refrigerator with you. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s stuff we can throw out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with those meals is they had too much seasoning,&#8221; Sam said. &#8220;Too spicy. Kept me awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you tell people not to use spices?&#8221; asked Adele.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t listen,&#8221; Sam said, smiling intolerantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Cynthia loudly. They looked at her. She held her head high and tilted. &#8220;Listen. There it is again.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at the refrigerator, its door covered with old newsparer clippings about family members. &#8220;Local resident finds Giant Mushroom,&#8221; was the biggest headline. The refrigerator was definitely making a loud noise. Things had changed for it, internally, and it was in some new and interfering gear. A steady rattling sound came from the motor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Cynthia.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the milk,&#8221; Adele pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you should take some more things out,&#8221; Cynthia said to Sam. Sam rose from his chair and shuffled to the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the things in it,&#8221; Adele said, exasperated. &#8220;If it were, taking them out would have helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Sam asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had been the milk, then since the milk is on the table the noise wouldn&#8217;t be coming again now,&#8221; Adele said. She was aware that she sounded unclear.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is coming again now,&#8221; said Sam, staring at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Adele, &#8220;but that means &#8211; &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take some more things out,&#8221; Cynthia said to Sam. The table was now nearly hidden by containers covered with aluminum foil, plates holding three or four shriveled carrots, pots with their lids on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want some of these things thrown out, mother?&#8221; Adele asked. &#8220;These are really mostly inedible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; Cynthia said firmly. She picked up her toast and took a small bite.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think your mother knows what she wants to keep and what she doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; Sam said. He was sprinkling bits of toast onto his soft-boiled egg. There was a silence while they ate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to write another letter to the Town Board,&#8221; Sam said, frowning thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; asked Adele. Her father was fond of writing letters to people and telling them what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;About that stop sign at the intersection of Beech Tree Lane and Route Thirty-five. I&#8217;ve told them before, but they still don&#8217;t seem to realise how badly designed that intersection is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they answer your letter from before?&#8221; Adele asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They answered it, but I don&#8217;t think they gave it the serious consideration that it deserves. I don&#8217;t think they were really paying any attention to it,&#8221; Sam said. He began to eat his toast and egg.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did write them twice,&#8221; Cynthia said.</p>

<p>Sam looked up at her. &#8220;But they haven&#8217;t properly responded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they did answer you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; said Sam, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they understand the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you did tell them,&#8221; Cynthia said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; Sam said fiercely. &#8220;You just told me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I told you that,&#8221; Cynthia said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying &#8211; &#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;re saying,&#8221; Sam said.</p>

<p>The telephone rang. Adele reached for it before her parents could answer it. Cynthia watched, waiting to be given the phone.<br>
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Adele, not looking at her mother, &#8220;yes it is. This is her daughter. Yes, that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s making a loud noise, that&#8217;s the problem. Here. Listen to it.&#8221; She held the telephone out toward the refrigerator, which had ratcheted up the sound level and was drumming loudly and at high speed. &#8220;Can you hear that?&#8221; She put the phone back to her ear. &#8220;All right. All right, we&#8217;ll be here. We&#8217;re not going out all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he coming over?&#8221; asked Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right away,&#8221; said Adele.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting dressed,&#8221; Cynthia said, getting up. Her toast lay on her plate, a small bite taken from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want the rest of your toast?&#8221; asked Adele, feeling bad about seizing the telephone call.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really hungry,&#8221; Cynthia said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about you, Daddy?&#8221; asked Adele. &#8220;If you want to get dressed I&#8217;ll do the dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the repairman arrived Sam and Cynthia were back down in the kitchen, now dressed. Cynthia was in the rocker by the telephone, and Sam was at his desk, writing the stiff letter to the Town. Adele opened the back door to the repairman. The refrigerator was humming quietly. Inaudibly, in fact. You could barely tell it was still on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s right here,&#8221; said Adele, embarrassed. &#8220;It was making quite a lot of noise. Could you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The repair man was tall and pleasant, and wore a green shirt with the name Jerry embroidered on the pocket. He put down a tool box. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just see what the problem is here,&#8221; he said, diplomatically not answering Adele.</p>

<p>Cynthia leaned forward in the rocking chair. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had too much food in there, I know,&#8221; she said apologetically. &#8220;It&#8217;s because of my husband&#8217;s hip operation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam appeared in the doorway, a letter in his hand. &#8220;I want to take this in to the Post Office,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The repairman stepped past Sam to get at the back of the refrigerator. He wrestled it gently out from the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we just put it in the mailbox?&#8221; Adele asked. &#8220;I have a stamp. I&#8217;ll take it out for you, if you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I want to mail it at the Post Office,&#8221; Sam said. He wasn&#8217;t yet able to drive, after the operation, so all the driving was done by Cynthia. &#8220;You about ready?&#8221; he asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221; she said, looking wild.</p>

<p>&#8220;To take me to the Post Office to mail this letter,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just waiting to see about the refrigerator,&#8221; Cynthia said. The refrigerator shuffled further out from the wall, toward the crammed table.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the refrigerator?&#8221; Sam asked, turning to look at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The noise,&#8221; Adele said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, the noise,&#8221; Sam said. He stood in the doorway for a moment, watching Jerry, then moved past the refrigerator and down to the other end of the kitchen table. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll fix this telephone, while I&#8217;m waiting,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with the telephone?&#8221; asked Adele. &#8220;I just used it. It seemed fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sam did not answer. He sat down at the table. The repair man came back out from the back of the refrigerator and knelt on the floor in front of it with a screwdriver.</p>

<p>Sam picked the phone up and set it down. &#8220;It wobbles,&#8221; he said accusingly. &#8220;When you set it down it wobbles.&#8221; He demonstrated: the phone rocked mildly. He turned the phone upside down, and he and Adele stared at the bottom of the phone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s missing a foot,&#8221; Adele pointed out. &#8220;That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s uneven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; Sam said. He set the phone back right-side up again and stood. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get something to fix it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you having any luck?&#8221; Cynthia asked the repair man. He was leaning into a mysterious dark space he had created at the front of the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said comfortably. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; Sam said, reappearing from the dining room, where his desk was. He sat down again by the telephone and turned it over, setting it down upside down. He had a small box of binder-hole reinforcers, small white gummed circles. He began licking them and sticking them painstakingly one on top of the other, pasting them on the bottom of the telephone where the missing foot was not, building it up layer by layer. Each time he pressed another small white circle on the plastic the telephone bumped against the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least don&#8217;t keep joggling the receiver,&#8221; said Adele. &#8220;I&#8217;ll unplug it,&#8221; she said, and disconnected the cord from the phone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the problem,&#8221; Jerry said, backing away on his knees from the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Cynthia asked, smiling at him.</p>

<p>He held up a yellowed newspaper clipping. &#8220;Sam Bolton hits Seventy-Five, still a high-scorer on his Hockey Team,&#8221; was the headline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my goodness,&#8221; said Cynthia, holding out her hand for it. She shook her head. &#8220;I guess I wondered where that was. We had it up on the refrigerator door with a magnet. And that&#8217;s what was making all that noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Jerry said. He was back inside the black hole again, replacing everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this, Sam,&#8221; Cynthia said.</p>

<p>The telephone rang, but for some reason not in the kitchen. The bell sounded shrilly in the living room. Sam ignored it, still pasting white circles on the bottom of the receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Daddy,&#8221; Adele said. She tried to take the telephone to answer it, but Sam, who had not heard it ring, looked up in irritation and would not release it. &#8220;Excuse me, Daddy, the phone is ringing,&#8221; she said. They wrestled briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The phone is ringing,&#8221; said Cynthia to Sam.</p>

<p>On the second ring Adele picked up the receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221; she said. The line was dead. The phone rang for the third time, still only in the living room, and Adele remembered that she had unplugged the cord. She looked for it, but it was no longer on the table. It must have been knocked to the floor, and rather than scramble for it there and try to fit it back into the tiny aperture before the caller hung up she decided to answer it in the living room.</p>

<p>As she stood up Cynthia said, &#8220;Would somebody please answer the phone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m working on it,&#8221; Sam said rebukingly. The phone rang a fourth time as Adele hurriedly stood and made for the door, panicky at the telephone&#8217;s repeated demand. She passed the refrigerator as Jerry stood up; they collided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Adele, flustered but still moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay,&#8221; said Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think someone could answer the phone?&#8221; Cynthia said generally in a strained voice.</p>

<p>In the living room Adele at last lifted the receiver. &#8220;Hello?&#8221; she said, breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is 911. We have received a request for help,&#8221; a man said, his voice loud and stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;911?&#8221; Adele repeated. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I am required to ask you questions. You may be forced to giving answers you don&#8217;t want to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wildly, Adele looked around, wondering for a bewildered moment if there were something she did not know, if she were being held fast by a hard-armed terrorist, a gun at her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Cynthia called in from the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;I must ask you further questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t call, really,&#8221; said Adele, trying to sound convincing. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong. It was a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is on the phone?&#8221; Cynthia called louder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 911,&#8221; shouted Adele.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Cynthia asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;911,&#8221; Adeled repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;911,&#8221; Cynthia said to Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they want?&#8221; Sam said to Cynthia.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your mother&#8217;s maiden name?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s maiden name?&#8221; Adele repeated. &#8220;Hogarth.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the man said quietly. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to send you some assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Adele, struggling to think. &#8220;It is Hogarth! That&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s maiden name. I promise you we&#8217;re all right. What name do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you Mrs. Samuel Bolton?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they want?&#8221; Sam shouted. &#8220;Why are they calling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They called because you called them,&#8221; Adele shouted back to him. To the man on the phone she said, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m her daughter. You want my grand-mother&#8217;s maiden name.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the kitchen she heard Jerry say, &#8220;I&#8217;m all through now, Mrs. Bolton. Is there anything else you need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Cynthia said weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not,&#8221; Sam called in to Adele. &#8220;What a ridiculous thing to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did too,&#8221; Adele said, putting her hand over the receiver. &#8220;You kept banging at the phone while you were pasting those things on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The 911 man paused cautiously. &#8220;We have to be very careful here. If you are Mrs. Bolton&#8217;s daughter, then do you want to give me your grandmother&#8217;s maiden name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t call 911,&#8221; Sam said loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chase,&#8221; Adele said triumphantly.</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re all right?&#8221; He sounded reluctant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can promise you,&#8221; Adele said in a heartfelt voice. &#8220;Everything here is fine. It&#8217;s perfectly fine. Don&#8217;t send assistance. Please.&#8221;</p>
