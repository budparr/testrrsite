  <div class="entry-content prose">
    <p>IN 1928 my grandparents built a summer house in northwestern Connecticut, on a wooded hillside overlooking a small lake. Trees cluster closely about its dark rough clapboards and massive chimneys; a stone porch looks out toward the water. It’s a refuge, knitted smoothly into the natural world around it.</p>

<p>My grandparents left the house to their three children, and while I was growing up, my family always spent a summer month there. Now I own it, and my husband and I are putting in insulation, heat. We’re changing little else: it’s still the family house, still represents my grandparents, my mother.</p>

<p>My mother is 96 and in an assisted-living home in Ithaca, N.Y. My older brother lives nearby and sees her every day. She has a pleasant, airy room overlooking a quiet street. The staff members are kind and attentive. I should be glad she’s there.</p>

<p>When I call her, she always knows it’s me. At least I think she does. After I say hello I say my name, just to be sure. There are five of us.</p>

<p>She sounds pleased to hear my voice, and I ask her how she is.</p>

<p>She says she’s sitting on her bed with her cat, Mokie. Then she asks, her voice warm: “But how are you? Tell me your news. Where are you now?”</p>

<p>“New York,” I say, “in the apartment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she says.</p>

<p>I know she doesn’t remember it.</p>

<p>My mother’s memory is fading in mysterious patches. It’s like ice melting in a pond: wide stretches have turned dark and treacherous, though other parts are still solid, still support our weight when we skate across them. But I know the season is changing, I know the ice won’t last.</p>

<p>New information is hardest for my mother, who doesn’t know the apartment well. The place she remembers is our old farmhouse in northern Westchester County, where for decades she and my father came each year for Christmas.</p>

<p>But that house has been sold, and my mother won’t visit me there again, nor anywhere else. Now all our visits will be made by me: my mother has been overtaken by age. Now every movement is excruciating, for her to make and for me to watch. Merely standing is difficult. She rises achingly slowly, straightening her shaking legs, shifting her weight onto unreliable knees. Once upright, she leans heavily on her battered walker, her torso nearly horizontal, her unwilling feet like stone. Her poor body is wearing out.</p>

<p>“And what have you been doing?” my mother asks me cheerfully.</p>

<p>“We went to Connecticut this weekend,” I say.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you?” Her voice fills with pleasure and reminiscence. “Did you stay at the house?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, it has no heat,” I remind her. “But we’re putting in a furnace.”</p>

<p>Sometimes my mother remembers that my husband and I now own the house, sometimes not.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” she says. “We never had a furnace.” Then she asks, “What season is it now?”</p>

<p>“Winter,” I say.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right. They take such good care of me here I don’t know what the weather’s like. And Mokie won’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“Mokie has her own projects,” I say.</p>

<p>“Mokie’s listening to us, but pretending she’s not,” my mother says. “She’s sitting with her back to me, but I can tell from her ears she’s listening.”</p>

<p>“Of course she’s listening,” I say, “this is a very interesting conversation.”</p>

<p>We both laugh, and then my mother says, “Well, tell me your news. Where are you now?”“</p>

<p>“I’m in New York,” I repeat, “but we went to Connecticut this weekend.”</p>

<p>“And who owns the house now?” she asks, trying to remember.</p>

<p>“I do,” I tell her. “You gave me your share, and I bought out the others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she says. “Well, I’d love to see it again.”</p>

<p>She often says this. No matter how forgetful she is, the house still seems present in her mind, whole and intact. She still knows the pale shining floors, the small-paned windows. She still knows how the lake shimmers in the sun, how it feels to push through the swinging door into the kitchen. All this is still with her.</p>

<p>Last summer, in her closet, I found a metal box. Inside was a small bundle, wrapped thickly in tissue paper. Carefully I unwound the soft layers, as though I were opening a present. At the core was a pair of figures: a bride and groom. They were grainy, dense, oddly heavy. They were discolored from age, but still dignified. The front of the groom’s face had dropped off, and looking at its rough empty expanse I suddenly remembered a day before my sister’s wedding. I was in the dining room, the small figure in one hand, a paintbrush in the other. My restoration was now barely visible — a few faint dabs on the broken surface, where eyes and mouth should be.</p>

<p>In the box was a note in my mother’s bold perpendicular hand. “Bride and Groom,” then, “On the wedding cake.” Following this were my grandparents’ initials, and their wedding date: Oct. 17, 1899. Then my parents’, Feb. 9, 1935, then my sisters’ and my own: July 16, 1961, May 13, 1967, June 30, 1978.</p>

<p>The house is full of these things. Its rooms hold the small bones of my mother’s life. Here is her history, my history, our family’s, widening and echoing, stretching back through the generations. This is both comforting and saddening to me. It is bewildering: with all this still here, how is it that my mother is slipping away?</p>

<p>“Then come and see it,” I say.</p>

<p>“I may. I may turn up,” my mother warns me. “I may just go out to the road and thumb a ride.”</p>

<p>She says this often, to get a laugh. She knows it’s funny. She knows how great the contrast is between this image of her — striding jauntily to the road, sticking her thumb out, carefree and confident — and what she’s become.</p>

<p>“O.K., I’ll be expecting you.” I answer easily, as though I’m actually there at the house, or as though she could actually reach it. Or as though anything at all could happen, beside what actually is, which is the terrible swift darkening of the ice.</p>

<p>“Come,” I tell her. “Stay as long as you want. Stay the rest of your life.”</p>
