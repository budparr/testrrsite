	<p>&ldquo;The energy here, and the drama of the book, is all about the tension of inhabiting a damaged mind as it attempts to right itself, through discipline, through rage, through alcohol, through family, and through therapy. The ups and downs of that long and harrowing journey home make <em>Sparta</em> a riveting and important contribution to the literature of the Iraq War and to anti-war literature in general.&rdquo;</p>

Ms. Robinson assiduously interviewed people who knew O’Keeffe and deftly collated masses of information.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;<em>Cost</em> is stunning. Each of the characters is so perfectly realized, each is made known to us with such heart and intelligence. This is a very big book: the territory of family is more fragile and dangerous than any geography we know, and Roxana Robinson has made life of that. I loved, admired, and was frankly undone by every minute of it.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Roxana Robinson is surely one of the most graceful stylists and psychologically perceptive writers working. <em>Cost </em>approaches the subject of drugs’ impact from an original and very significant angle. This book shows further the extent of Robinson’s insights into the whirl, the generational ironies at work, and the desperate indulgences to which we turn in our confusion. <em>Cost</em> is an important, timely book that furthers insight into our present fortunes and dilemmas.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The satisfactions of Robinson’s first novel are many: her fluid prose and graceful construction, her sure sense of character and place, her skill in depicting the texture of daily life as well as the turning points in relationships, and her sympathetic understanding of the stresses within a family. Laura is almost 30 and ‘treading water.’ Not quite divorced from her chronically unfaithful, immature husband, Nat, she is living with but unable to commit to her lover, Ward, terrified of failing her 4-year-old son, Sam, and equally afraid of being a failure as a photographer. Laura, Ward, and Sam are spending the summer in Northeast Harbour, Maine, sharing a house with her sister Sarah and brother-in-law Richie (Laura’s first love) and their two adolescent daughters. Long since convinced that she is ‘worthless,’ a consequence of her rebellion against her stern, moralizing Quaker parents, Laura makes excuses for her inability to decide her future. When she allows Nat to fly up one weekend to see Sam, she unwittingly precipitates a crisis in her relationship with Ward, but her anguish leads to insights, and she finally sees her own behavior patterns clearly and begins to free herself from crippling inertia. In compact but elegant prose that conveys the essence of somnolent summer days by the sea, Robinson moves her narrative to a moment of near tragedy, in which Laura’s tentative choices become luminously clear. This book should plant Robinson squarely on the literary map.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;This biography, the first to draw on sources unavailable during O’Keeffe’s lifetime—and the first to be granted her family’s cooperation—offers a persuasive feminist analysis of the life and work of an iconic figure in American art. Inspired by strong women in a midwestern family that stressed a sturdy sense of self-reliance, O’Keeffe bucked oppressive social conventions to become one of the first female American artists to lead a professionally successful and emancipated life. But along the way lay struggle: O’Keeffe had to fight for emotional and artistic independence in her public and private lives, experiencing particular difficulties in her relationships with men, most notably her benefactor and husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz. Novelist Robinson’s (<em>Summer Light</em>) detailed, sensitive critique of O’Keeffe’s work, tracing the development of the artist’s esthetic, alternates with an absorbing, intimate narrative of O’Keeffe’s personal life (including her notorious relationship with Juan Hamilton, six decades her junior, and the public battle over her estate) to provide a resourceful, imaginatively rendered portrait of a dauntingly difficult subject.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Set in Manhattan town houses, ancestral country homes, and island getaways, the 15 stories in Robinson’s second collection (after <em>A Glimpse of Scarlet and Other Stories</em>) serve as clear windows into the posh world of East Coast WASPs. What’s revealed within their elegantly constructed frames isn’t picture-perfect, however, as the author subtly plumbs modern, often fragmented, family dynamics and the trials of the unhappily wed, the broken-up, and the back-together, as well as the travails of the children who must adapt to them. In “Mr. Sumarsono&rdquo; (which was included in<em>The Best American Short Stories 1994</em>), Robinson delineates how a 10-year-old girl who believes her single mother to be an embarrassment comes to realize that their houseguest, an Indonesian diplomat, instead views her as a “glowing, self-assured, generous woman.&ldquo; With irony and suspense, “Slipping Away&rdquo; recounts how a woman conducting a cautious affair is tormented by her husband’s spying. Finally, she is worn down from her customarily placid and organized existence into what she considers to be the “landscape of drama and passion&quot; of her Spanish-speaking maid. In “Leaving Home,&ldquo; 13-year-old Alison Thatcher believes herself a “fraud,&rdquo; interpreting the raging emotions of adolescence as proof of her lack of the famous Thatcher quality of integrity. Her subsequent act of rebellion cements her feelings by deliberately breaking from integrity…and from her family. Robinson reveals her characters through a striking combination of nuance, empathy, and wit.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The terrain of upper-middle-class WASP families and the country of divorce are explored with perceptive candor in Robinson’s powerful and affecting novel. Emma Goodwin and Peter Chatfield move in the socially elite circles of Manhattan’s Upper East Side. When they marry after having divorced their first spouses, each brings a daughter to the new union. Three-year-old Tessa, Emma’s child, is adorable and secure, but seven-year-old Amanda, Peter’s already difficult daughter, proves sullen and rebellious. Although she can’t admit it to herself, Emma favors and nurtures her own daughter, while Peter, not recognizing Amanda’s fear and misery, is annoyed by her continuing defiance. Through insidious undercurrents of resentment and periodic confrontations, Amanda’s self-confidence is eventually destroyed. Robinson is particularly adept at conveying the nuances of children’s thoughts and behavior, and she sees clearly that they are the real victims of divorce, though readers feel equal sympathy for all players in the drama. Robinson renders the girls’ bickering, Amanda’s scornful negativity, and the guilt and recrimination that erode the Chatfields’ marriage with emotional authority. These scenes occur against the convincingly textured background of private clubs and summer homes, the snobbish pride in blood over money, and sometimes, the cultivation of stingy economy over unseemly display. The last third of the book is hypnotic and achingly real, all too imaginable for parents who will recognize that unconscious acts have their tragic consequences. The author of two collections of short stories, the novel <em>Summer Light</em> and a biography of Georgia O’Keeffe, Robinson writes lucid and graceful prose that shines with compassion and wisdom about human frailty.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Robinson’s third collection proves her a master of the short story (she has also written three novels, including 2003’s <em>Sweetwater</em>). Her finely tuned realism, as well as her settings and characters: New York, its bedroom communities, the Eastern seaboard, and the comfortable upper-middle-class living there recall Cheever and Updike&hellip;.Robinson approaches the huge misunderstandings of family life from many angles and anything but timidly. In ‘Family Christmas,’ a child confronted with adult mysteries says, ‘I knew that this language I was trying to learn could not be learned directly, that it was something that had to be absorbed blindly and obliquely&hellip;.We would have to learn it through signs, inflections, looks and sighs and tones of voice.’ Robinson is unusually good with the ‘strange foreign tongue’ of the elderly: the aristocratic grandparents of ‘Family Christmas’; the dogged, long-married battlers of ‘Assistance’; the malevolent Santa Fe misanthrope of ‘Shame’; the befuddled British visitor of the title story. Even the younger couples in the only linked stories, ‘Choosing Sides’ and ‘Assez,’ are grandparents, and what they say about grandparenthood is arresting. But the collection’s most affecting stories touch on the chasm between parents and children, husbands and wives. Robinson’s ear is wonderful, her graceful prose a real pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

By letting the reader live in Conrad’s skin, Robinson creates a moving chronicle of how we fail our returning troops.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;These stories of upper-middle-class family life concern relationships between men and women, mistrust and infidelities, broken families, and stepparents and stepchildren. With characteristic delicacy and empathy, Robinson probes the terrible emotional constrictions her characters suffer in such stories as ‘Handicapped,’ ‘The Time for Kissing,’ and ‘Tears Before Bedtime.’ Other stories trace the complexities of friendship and forgiveness and the devotion and resignation of old age. In the title story, a suspicious wife makes much of her husband&rsquo;s casual lunch date, recalling her own affair and that of a couple seen by chance on the street—in ‘a moment of widening freedom, possibility’ implied merely by ‘a glimpse of scarlet’ in the woman’s scarf or sleeve. Robinson’s stories have been published in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, and <em>The Southern Review</em>. She is also the author of the novel <em>Summer Light</em> (LJ 6/1/88) and <em>Georgia O’Keeffe: A Life</em> (LJ 9/15/89). A touchingly intimate, human collection.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Fourteen finely wrought and revealing stories about the not-so-gentle sting of WASP-y love, from novelist (<em>Summer Light</em>) and biographer (Georgia O’Keeffe) Robinson. In ‘The Time for Kissing,’ a grown daughter, Susannah, sorts through images from her past in an effort to come to some sort of understanding with her willfully remote mother. Just as Susannah is ready to risk it—to try to cross old barricades of correctness—her mother manages to rebuff her in a final and desperately sad fashion.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>“Thirteen splendid stories in an elegant third collection from Robinson (<em>Sweetwater</em>, 2003, etc.) range widely to give us a peek into the obsessions and troubles of the well-versed and well-off.</p>

<p>“The title story inserts a British opera expert into the suburban guest room of a volunteer for a local music festival. The hostess is so eager to please the festival head that she doesn’t bother to ask her husband if he would mind a ‘perfect stranger’ as a houseguest for the weekend. By the end of this deft tale, Robinson has captured all three characters beautifully, along with the shifting nuances of marriage. ‘The Treatment’ begins bluntly (‘Here is what I do each morning’) and proceeds to describe in suspenseful detail the horrors and hopes of a woman who takes a ‘chilled golden globe’ from the refrigerator each morning, warming up a powerful antibiotic she must feed into a plastic tube inserted into her bloodstream, in hopes it will cure her of a long-term disease. The narrator of ‘The Football Game’ compares her own artist father and progressive mother unfavorably to her boarding school roommate’s family (‘Their family seemed to unwind, like a spool, into a perfectly woven fabric&hellip;.’). By the end of the Yale–Bowdoin game, where the two girls keep her parents waiting while they dally with two Yalies, she has learned that the world outside her family was much larger than she had imagined and more complicated ‘more dangerous and beautiful.’ ‘The Face-Lift’ follows the years-long trajectory of a friendship between former classmates, one a Pennsylvania country girl, the other a wealthy, seemingly carefree Salvadoran. The narrator, divorced and childless, seems to envy Cristina’s wealth, her marriage, her children, until she learns of a violent incident in San Salvador that almost cost Cristina her life.</p>

<p>“Stories that tick away with the precision of perfectly wrought timepieces.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>“Dramatic, fast-paced, boasting both engaging characters and an optimistic resolution of its conflict, this well-written novel will make good summer reading. It explores contemporary family life and relationships on a number of levels as its protagonist, Laura, seeks to come to terms with her roles as woman, mother, sister, aunt, daughter, wife, and lover. On vacation in Maine with her small son, her lover, and her sister’s family, and contending with a visit from her estranged husband, Laura is forced to evaluate these various, often-conflicting roles. Although the novel is undemanding and its solutions seem glib and easy, the pleasant style and the author’s control of her subject recommend it.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>“Critically acclaimed but not well known, Robinson will reach a broader audience with this hold-your-breath novel of loss and love. Devoted to her work for Environmental Protection Resources, Isabel is trying hard to recover from the shock of her first husband’s death. She likes Paul’s thoughtfulness and convinces herself that a peaceful rather than passionate second marriage is appropriate. Loving wilderness, she embarks optimistically on a vacation in the Adirondacks with Paul’s parents and brother, Whitney. But rather than contentedly contemplating nature, Isabel finds herself embroiled in tricky family conflicts. Alarmed by Paul’s simmering fury and dangerously attracted to Whitney, she is assailed by painful memories of her harrowing first marriage, which Robinson skillfully sets in chilling counterpoint to the increasingly heated dynamics of Isabel’s present predicament. As family strife turns incendiary, forest fires erupt on the drought-afflicted landscape, and Isabel fights for her life in an emotional and literal inferno. Writing with rapturous intensity of nature both wild and human, Robinson forges a love story of unusual complexity and satisfaction.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Robinson tells tales of psychic maladies with spellbinding intensity and acute insight. In <em>Cost</em> (2008), she explored drug addiction; here, she occupies the PTSD-assaulted mind of an Iraq War veteran. Conrad had everything going for him as the oldest child in a loving and achieving Westchester County family. Smart, handsome, poised, and enthralled by his college studies as a classics major, he decides to seek his own <em>Sparta</em> by joining the marines, thus shocking his ‘bookish and liberal’ parents. A kind and devoted officer, Conrad is appalled to find himself not in a noble and orderly military realm but, rather, in a morass of chaos, terror, futility, and crimes against humanity. Safely home at last, he is determined to restart his life, but all his discipline and training prove worthless in contending with searing insomnia, debilitating headaches, and ungovernable anger, fear, and hypervigilance. A war hero who now feels threatened in his boyhood bedroom, let alone on the jostling, hurrying streets of New York City, Conrad seeks treatment from the VA only to become ensnarled in another form of combat. Robinson’s diligently researched and profoundly realized tale of a warrior’s trauma and his family’s struggle to help him is a beautifully incisive, respectful, suspenseful, and indicting drama of our failure to grasp the full toll of war.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>“Of WASP heritage, but not of the upper-crust, East Coast variety, I came to the works of their literary chroniclers like a spy. The exclusive clubs and watering holes portrayed by John Cheever and Louis Auchincloss were nearly as distant from my middle-class, Midwestern experience as they must have been for the offspring of Italian or Jewish immigrants. All of us were uninvited outsiders peering through the windows, sometimes in awe, sometimes in dismay.</p>

<p>“In the novels and stories of Roxana Robinson, the accoutrements of Upper East Side WASP life are kept discreetly in the background. Nannies, private-school educations, and the good life expected to follow are taken for granted. What Robinson never lets us forget, though, is that privilege is no protection against pain. Disappointment, heartache, and death await us all.</p>

<p>“<em>Summer Light</em>, Robinson’s 1988 debut novel, depicts a woman weighing her perplexing choice between an unfaithful husband and a sometime lover. <em>This Is My Daughter</em>, her next, dramatizes the pitfalls of second marriage. The ambiguities of love and marriage also echo throughout Robinson’s story collections, <em>A Glimpse of Scarlet and Other Stories</em> and <em>Asking for Love</em>.</p>

<p>“Although Isabel Green, the heroine of Robinson’s new novel, <em>Sweetwater</em>, can’t claim membership in the WASP elite, she was brought up among them in Westchester County’s tony Bedford Hills, where her father served as an Episcopalian priest. Now, several years after the death of her first husband, Michael, she marries into WASP old money.</p>

<p>“Both Isabel and her new husband, Paul Simmons, are public-spirited Upper East Siders. Paul has enough money that there’s no need to worry about making more. While he works for a foundation that supports medical research, Isabel can continue writing on water pollution for an activist environmental law firm.</p>

<p>“Still not over her grief, Isabel, at 47, has come to her second marriage with lowered expectations. Love isn’t essential to the equation. ‘All the other things—wildness and bliss&hellip;the urgency of sex—lay behind her&hellip;. hat she aimed for now was loyalty and affection&hellip;.[S]he didn’t want to be old alone.</p>

<p>“Seven months after the wedding, Isabel arrives with Paul at the Adirondacks lodge that has been summer home for the Simmons clan since the 1890s. Casually rustic yet grand in family memories, Sweetwater quietly proclaims a heritage of entitlement. Here she will have the opportunity to better know her parents-in-law, Douglas and Charlotte, and to meet Paul’s brother, Whit. But once this rugged outdoorsman enters the picture, it’s clear to Isabel (and to the reader) that she’s married the wrong brother.</p>

<p>“What nonetheless provides urgency to the story are two parallel dramas, Isabel’s past with Michael and her present dilemma. Here Robinson’s superior literary skills come into play. She employs neither fancy prose nor postmodernist sleight-of-hand. Instead, she sets up subtle calibrations of mood and character, almost exclusively through telling dialogue. Thus Robinson exposes Paul’s adolescent querulousness and his mother’s penchant for unreflective harsh judgments.</p>

<p>“In the past, we see the young Isabel drawn like a moth to Michael’s flame of intelligence and energy. This despite her increasing awareness of the debilitating paralysis of his depressions. In her naïveté, she hopes to save him. As Michael&rsquo;s journalism career blazes from the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> to a <em>Time</em>-like magazine in New York to its London bureau and back, the darkness periodically closes him down, shuts out Isabel, and pushes her closer to quitting the marriage. Only the presence of a son, Ben, and her desire for another child puts off the inevitable.</p>

<p>“By contrast, Paul’s kindness, good humor, and steadiness seemed a welcome respite from Michael’s rages and emotional lockdowns. At Sweetwater, however, Isabel begins to see a far less appealing Paul—defensive, volatile, perpetually and sophomorically at war with his brother. ‘You’re 45 and still scrambling around in the dirt,’ Paul sneers at him.</p>

<p>“Never mind that Whit, who studies mountain-lion behavior in Wyoming, is a respected conservation biologist. Paul is too shortsighted to see that both he and his brother have been wounded by parental expectations that they take up professions that bore them, banking or business.</p>

<p>“The book’s notable flaw is that Isabel’s son, Ben, figures so little in the story we wonder why the author bothered to include him. Because it’s not Ben’s boyish animal warmth that comforts during Michael’s spells but the distraction of work, we’re astonished to find Isabel desperately wanting another baby in her early 40s, even to the extent of undergoing in vitro fertilization. She may have hoped for a daughter and the eventual consolation of female companionship, but we’re just relieved for her that the effort failed.</p>

<p>“Throughout, water provides an apt metaphor for nourishment and the possibility of second (or third) chances. ‘[I]n a natural system,’ Isabel observes, ‘water purified itself. Water was always in the process of returning to its limpid, pristine, original self, a tendency [she] found mysterious and oddly touching, an unexpected note of grace.’</p>

<p>“<em>Sweetwater</em> abounds with grace notes, for sure, but never at the expense of hard-won, painful truths. This is domestic fiction with bite.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>“Roxana Robinson often writes about the privileged, and one of her strengths is evoking sympathy for people who seem to have every advantage yet suffer nonetheless. She visits this territory again in a fine collection of short stories that explores with delicacy, wit, and a good deal of empathy, the angst that afflicts the comfortable.</p>

<p>“Robinson is particularly adept at writing about women who have grown up cosseted as well as constricted by their belief that life has rules that ought to be obeyed, even as they see others thrive—or seem to—by breaking free.</p>

<p>“In the first of the collection’s 13 stories, ‘Family Christmas,’ a young girl visiting her wealthy grandparents witnesses a shouting match between her proper grandfather and the crude husband of the beloved family housekeeper, an encounter the child knows is important, although she cannot say why. She is clear on one point: some things are not meant to be discussed: ‘You had to be careful in talking to grown-ups, it was like talking to foreigners&hellip;.I waited for the next thing that would happen, for the grown-ups to take charge again. I didn’t understand these things, and I knew that no one would explain them to me.’</p>

<p>“The confused girl reappears in various guises as an adult, still trying to understand how the world really works. In ‘The Face-Lift,’ she’s the staid former roommate of a fabulously rich, spoiled woman from San Salvador who has flouted almost every rule, yet remains for the narrator a wild alter ego to be admired and forgiven her many trespasses. Similarly, in ‘Choosing Sides,’ an American woman, caught up in her son’s troubles and at odds with her husband, finds succor from a free-thinking friend in France, a woman she calls <em>la jumelle</em>—her twin.</p>

<p>“Several of the stories are set in France, in this book a land where the emotions that must be restrained at home can be indulged. ‘Pilgrimage’ is one of the Paris stories and easily the book’s most humorous. Here a woman falls head over heels but not for a man. It’s a shop that infatuates her, and like most enchantments, it ends with a rude awakening.</p>

<p>“Funny in a sardonic, sad way is ‘Assistance,’ in which the grown daughter of an elderly couple almost crippled by their crotchety ways becomes exasperatingly tangled in their rapidly devolving life.</p>

<p>“Several stories are marred by their too-neat endings, didactic summings-up that offer moral lessons an astute reader already understands. But others are subtler and all the more powerful for it. ‘At the Beach’ explores, from a husband’s point of view, the sheer awfulness of a quarrel that almost derails a marriage. It is written with impressive economy.</p>

<p>“The most haunting of all is ‘The Treatment,’ a tale of a woman who must infuse herself daily with an antibiotic to combat a long-standing illness. The description of the process—a sort of holy medicinal sacrament that the woman believes means salvation—is stunningly written and vividly sensual. But Robinson takes it further, introducing a visiting nurse who is, if not quite the angel of death, then certainly an angel of disillusionment who makes no attempt to comfort the afflicted.</p>

<p>“<em>A Perfect Stranger</em> is a strong collection from a writer who knows that within each adult forever resides that bewildered child, still seeking to understand what the grown-ups are talking about, still making his or her way in an eternally foreign land.&ldquo;</p>

The air is hushed and motionless, sounds are close and intimate, the plants and trees are huge and luxuriant from the summer in the solar greenhouse of the city.’</p>

<p>“It’s that pensive light, along with the grand assemblage of broken and mended lives in a world where East 70s brownstones stay dark the entire summer and where air kisses are sometimes the sincerest form of love one can offer up, that makes clear Ms. Robinson may be John Cheever’s heir apparent.</p>

<p>“Like Cheever, too, she doesn’t relegate her stories only to New York but includes its branch campuses: the Hamptons; Greenwich, Connecticut; as well as elegant vacation sites abroad. There are the requisite indiscretions, the post-dinner party fights, the affairs both known and suspected.</p>

<p>“As in her novel, <em>Summer Light</em>—Ms. Robinson is also the author of <em>Georgia O’Keeffe: A Life</em>—the core of these stories is the tenuous and frightening world of lost familial love and the equally shaky battle to forge it anew. ‘Graduation,’ the story of a woman attending her son’s commencement at a Rhode Island boarding school, is infused with the terror she feels at having to face her former husband, his new wife, and their baby. Filled with remorse at never having been able to conceive another child, she’s both heartened and mournful that her maternal love, ‘this blissful, legitimate, uncomplicated tide of love,’ will be given to only one son. The son, however, is being manipulated by his father until, by the story’s end, even her anchor, the attention and love of her son, seems dislodged.</p>

<p>“In ‘Night Vision,’ Steven and Lisa, both in their second marriage, are en route to a Swiss ski vacation at Interlaken. It’s late, Steven is ‘rumpled, cold, tired,’ but even through his exhaustion he manages to make clear in his own mind the nature of second marriages: ‘Their first marriages loomed, dangerous passages, in their adult lives. He had owned his first wife’s past, he knew her early loves, her childhood, and he had offered up his own. But he and Lisa each had a great failure behind them—there were things he could not bear to know about her, and things of his own he would rather not share.’ Yet even in the face of a past best kept anonymous, there comes in the quiet of the night train a startlingly intimate admission of Lisa’s that reveals the true and sorrowful depth of the love she holds for him.</p>

<p>“The uncertain invincibility of marriage is made most apparent in the title story: a happily married woman walking the tree-shaded East 70s sees what she knows is the end of an afternoon tryst when a man in a gray suit leans into a darkened doorway for one last kiss. The woman sees inside the doorway only ‘a glimpse of something red, a violent color, vivid and hot.’ From this small glimpse the narrator ponders the design of forbidden love, its perilous joy and freedom: ‘All that risk, the guilt, the danger, balanced against something so rich, so sumptuous, so imperative that he had no choice but to risk it all.’</p>

<p>“Only after the witness herself turns down the opportunity to start up again with an old lover, and after it appears her husband is on the brink of finding a lover of his own, does the specter of an affair and the ‘extremity, the secrecy, and the great violence of the pleasure’ make itself known, fidelity finally prevailing in its own twisted blessing.</p>

<p>“There are a few missteps here. ‘Second Chances,’ about parental acceptance, relies too heavily on the metaphor of a homemade piecrust. And the story ‘Snowfall, although it tries not to, reads like a politically correct apology for the stories of the landed gentry that will follow.</p>

<p>“But these flaws seem insignificant against the tremendous success of the other stories. I read them slowly, and then more slowly, finally allowing myself one story a night, the terrible weight of newly endangered and newly forged familial love so beautifully and profoundly rendered. Roxana Robinson’s first collection of stories is at once poignant and brutal, a book of New York stories filled with the bitter joys and tender sorrows of marriage and parenthood.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>“The editors of an influential British anthology recently set off a debate in the pages of <em>The Guardian</em> that spread through the literary blogosphere. In their introduction to ‘New Writing 13,’ Toby Litt and Ali Smith remarked that ‘on the whole, the submissions from women were disappointingly domestic&hellip;as if too many women writers have been injected with a special drug that keeps them dulled, good, saying the right thing, aping the right shape, and melancholy at doing it, depressed as hell.’ Trying to subdue the ensuing firestorm, Litt and Smith later argued that they didn&rsquo;t object to domestic subjects per se but to ‘the lack of risk-taking in the writing itself.’ (Back in 1998, in <em>Harper’s</em> magazine, Francine Prose addressed a similar perception of American women writers.)</p>

<p>“The 13 stories in Roxana Robinson’s new collection—which explore relationships between people, usually family members, without benefit of flip-book-style illustrations, footnotes, or other daredevilry of fashionable form—brand her as just the type of woman writer the editors of ‘New Writing 13’ might hastily dismiss as ‘disappointingly domestic.’ And that would be a loss, because the best stories in <em>A Perfect Stranger</em> illuminate those sudden, mysterious internal shifts that allow us to feel forgiveness or the weight of our errors, that alchemize envy into admiration, shame into triumph, that carry us across the spectrum of human experience in a single moment even as they remind us of the fecundity of everyday life.</p>

<p>“Robinson manages this feat by paying close attention to the nuances that reveal people’s interior lives, a trait that she often bestows on her characters. The narrator of ‘Family Christmas,’ recalling her childhood attempts to understand her parents’ conversation and, by extension, the adult world, recognizes that this information ‘had to be absorbed’ through ‘signs, inflections, looks and sighs and tones of voice.’ When the husband of her grandparents’ cook drunkenly confronts her <em>grandpère</em>, the narrator intuits more about the scene than she realizes: ‘Part of what I felt was shame&hellip;.Shame for other people’s misery, shame that it had lain naked and exposed before us, shame that we’d seen it.’ By having the child, not the adults, register this truth, Robinson suggests that we can become less perceptive as we grow older, through our willful inurement to life’s inequities and despair.</p>

<p>“Robinson, who is also the author of three novels, two previous story collections, and a biography of Georgia O’Keeffe, is particularly good at charting the ebb and flow of affection and fury within relationships. In the title story, a husband and wife privately feud while playing host to an opera scholar for the weekend. Jeffrey, whose wife, Martha, agreed to put up this ‘perfect stranger’ without consulting him, ‘felt ill used, and also rather noble, for rising so well to the occasion.’ In the kitchen, he reassures their guest that having him stay is ‘our pleasure,’ while in the privacy of his bathroom he slams the lid of the laundry hamper in a petulant display. For her part, Martha is too concerned with impressing the local music festival’s lectures committee to acknowledge her part in her husbands passive-aggressive behavior. But when an emergency—their keys locked in the car—forces them back into solidarity, Martha recognizes the fluctuations that characterize, even strengthen, their marriage: ‘They were in this, whatever it was, together, both of them struggling with the waves of emotion, both carrying burdens of anger and love.’</p>

<p>“In the genteel orbit of Robinson’s stories, people fight against being ‘hemmed in by a jostling throng of rules and expectations’ and try to overcome a brooding disenchantment with their lives. Occasionally, you can feel the author’s hand too firmly on her characters’ backs, pushing them toward tidy resolutions. In the first pages of ‘The Football Game,’ the teenage narrator’s unmitigated admiration for her roommate’s parents—whose pastimes of tailgating, martini drinking, and garden-club meetings seem reassuringly normal compared with those of her shaggy-haired, abstract-expressionist painter father and bohemian-style yet oddly prim mother—telegraph an imminent reversal of positions. More often, though, Robinson remains in the background, quietly allowing her meticulous observations to convey the quotidian in all its perfect strangeness.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>“Reading <em>Sweetwater</em>, a novel by Roxana Robinson (<em>This Is My Daughter</em>), is a lot like watching an Olympic diver. We are vaguely aware of the structure and form that holds the diver’s efforts together and yet entranced with the beauty presented. We watch, our breath held, anticipating little errors because we’ve seen just how difficult such feats are to execute flawlessly. Nail it, we silently urge&hellip;.</p>

<p>“Abundant in poetic language and incisive imagery, Robinson unfolds what seems, at first, to be a subdued story about relationships and love but which slowly reveals ever-dilating depth and breadth. The book plumbs the subject of human communion and how necessary this connection is to sustain life. Like the precious water Isabel shepherds, the human spirit is a marvel to behold…and fragile. Robinson frames this vista with an expertly constructed narrative. And when she pulls off the ending with breathtaking skill, the effect is utterly satisfying.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Roxana Robinson’s amazing new novel is about insightful people who go too long without introspecting and about judicious people who quite simply make errors in judgment. I love the way her characters come to consciousness and the way the reader is always brought up short along with them. Reading it, I felt sure we’re all in this together: our defenses quickly invoked only to be worn down, while at the same time we were increasingly experiencing life with our eyes wide open—with the hope held out by the author that eventually our hearts might open as well. It’s a very impressive book.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;If divorce rips a family apart, can a second marriage mend the tear, piecing the remnants together into one big Brady Bunch quilt? Of course not. In <em>This Is My Daughter</em>, New Yorkers Peter Chatfield and Emma Goodman learn this the hard way. Roxana Robinson—whose dissection of WASP mores in <em>Asking for Love</em> and <em>Summer Light</em> earned her comparisons to such white-shoe masters as John Cheever, Edith Wharton, and Henry James—is on familiar ground here, placing Peter and Emma within the gilded cocoon of Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Recently divorced, socially superior, and smarting from subhuman ex-spouses, the two have much in common, not least the desire to marry again. Emma’s daughter, Tess, warms to the idea immediately. But for Peter’s sullen seven-year-old, this union signals a disaster rather than a fresh start: “Amanda could not be happy that her father was marrying Emma&hellip;.She was already, at seven, in mourning for her life, for her past and happy life, that other world.&rdquo; Over the next eight years, Amanda’s inability to deal with her father’s remarriage, which the adults dismiss as mere adolescent angst, becomes a sizable thorn in the family’s side. Despite all of Peter and Emma’s best-laid plans—private schools, a picture-perfect summer home in New England, tennis clinics, invites to exclusive parties—Amanda grows increasingly alienated, and with one desperate act, she forces the family to peel back their moneyed exterior and examine the heart of the matter. In <em>This Is My Daughter</em>, Robinson has created a skillful and sensitive portrayal of divorce and its post-nuclear-family fallout.&ldquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Roxana Robinson’s <em>Sparta</em> delicately explores the fissures between the military experience and civilian life with this portrait of a liberal northeastern family and what happens when their son, a young Marine lieutenant, returns home from Iraq irrevocably changed. This book is not simply about war but about the horror and enforced isolation of trauma, the inevitable merging of the personal and the political, and the possibilities and trials found within the bonds of familial and romantic love.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Robinson’s sympathy for the deeply messed-up Conrad and his fellow vets is as impressive as her knowledge of their circumstances. How could she know what it’s like to be blown up by an IED? How does she know about the macabre jokes soldiers tell to keep themselves sane? In fact, Robinson interviewed several vets to give her book the verisimilitude it needed. Their stories must have been excruciating to hear, but they needed to be heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Their stories, or at least Conrad’s story, also deserve to be told. Full of the grief and deep compassion that’s becoming Robinson’s trademark, <em>Sparta</em> is a brilliant, necessary work.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Pardon the pun, but Roxana Robinson’s new novel, &lsquo;<em>Sparta</em>,&rsquo; which takes us deep inside the troubled head of a Marine returning from four years of active duty in Iraq, really is a tour de force. Robinson, whose varied bibliography ranges from a biography of Georgia O’Keeffe to her preceding novel, &lsquo;Cost,&rsquo; about a family dealing with a son’s heroin addiction, surprises us again with the unexpected subject.</p>

<p>&rdquo;<em>Sparta&#39;</em> is a novel with a mission — which in a lesser writer’s hands could spell its doom. But Robinson manages to convey the difficulties of a warrior returning to society and dramatize how we fail our veterans without reducing her story to a polemic. She pulls this off by expertly deploying three literary weapons: emotional insight, moral nuance and intellectual depth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robinson has created a character to whom even liberal, antiwar Easterners can relate. Conrad Farrell is a classics major at Williams College whose thesis is on the ancient Greek warrior culture of <em>Sparta</em>. When he announces his intention to join the Marines in the spring of 2001, his parents are aghast — even though the country is not at war. &lsquo;Their family was bookish and liberal, not martial and authoritarian,&rsquo; Robinson writes. But Conrad insists that he wants &lsquo;to do something that has consequences. This is the biggest challenge I know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Fast forward to 2006. Conrad is headed home to his family’s lovely old farmhouse in Katonah, N.Y. But &lsquo;he wasn’t the person they were expecting to meet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he didn’t know how to change himself back.&rsquo; That, in a nutshell, is the returning warrior’s predicament.</p>

<p>&quot;By embedding herself in 26-year-old Conrad’s point of view, Robinson brings the tolls of war up close. She captures the terrors of flashbacks, insomnia, headaches, panic attacks, impotence, inchoate rage and suicidal thoughts — all symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD). Although no longer in danger, Conrad finds it impossible to let down his guard. He’s leery of crowds and windows. He flies into a terrifying rage when a woman’s handbag knocks into him in a crowded restaurant.</p>

<p>&quot;Unable to penetrate Conrad’s armor, his increasingly alarmed family and girlfriend keep asking, &lsquo;How are you really?&rsquo; But he finds it impossible to talk about the Iraqi children murdered in their beds or the member of his platoon trapped in a burning Humvee whose doors are welded shut by the heat of an improvised explosive device — never mind his mounting doubts about the mission.</p>

<p>&quot;Robinson replays these horrors in a torturous loop. While it is remarkable how many ways she finds to describe panic attacks — &lsquo;hovering over him like a tornado funnel,&rsquo; as if on perpetual night guard duty — her portrait of PTSD is so relentless that it occasionally threatens to overwhelm not just her character but her novel. Conrad feels his platoon’s absence &lsquo;like a phantom limb&rsquo; and tries to keep in e-mail touch with his men. But he holds that Marines don’t complain, and so he pushes himself to prepare for graduate school despite his escalating despair. He quickly wears out his welcome at his girlfriend’s and sister’s New York apartments.</p>

<p>&quot;As she prepared to write this novel, Robinson talked to a number of Iraq war veterans and read Sebastian Junger’s &lsquo;War,&rsquo; Dexter Filkins’s &lsquo;The Forever War&rsquo; and Anthony Swofford’s &lsquo;Jarhead&rsquo; among others. Her explanation of the mishandled early missions in Fallujah and the clash between the long-ruling minority Sunnis and the majority Shiites is as clear as any I’ve read. So, too, is her fascinating primer on the severe and ultimately doomed warrior culture of <em>Sparta</em>, which provides an underlying cautionary tale for her book.</p>

<p>&quot;But it’s Robinson’s portrait of the Veterans Affairs system that is most devastating. When Conrad becomes desperate enough to seek help, the response is outrageously inadequate. He finally gains entry after waiting four months, only to meet for a few minutes with a distracted doctor who hands him a fistful of prescriptions — most with suicidal side effects — and tells him to get back to him in three months. It’s appalling. &lsquo;He’d thought that there was some sort of compact — wasn’t there? He was offering his life for his country, and his country would be there when he came home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Robinson demonstrated her deftness in handling the dynamics of a family under duress in &lsquo;Cost.&rsquo; In &lsquo;<em>Sparta</em>,&rsquo; the Farrells are a more congenial, highly functional bunch who are nonetheless stymied by Conrad’s condition. One small reservation about Robinson’s otherwise convincing scenario: It seems astonishing that his father, a law professor, and his mother, a family therapist, wouldn’t have done a little research into what their son was going through and intervened to make sure he got help.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be wonderful if &lsquo;<em>Sparta&rsquo;</em> led to improvements in mental-health care for veterans, but at the very least, it is bound to add understanding to their plight. Although too carefully wrought to be called improvised, Robinson’s powerful novel demonstrates that fiction actually can function as a sort of explosive device.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>“<em>Cost</em> will get tagged immediately as that story about heroin addiction, but what’s best about Roxana Robinson’s scarily good novel has nothing to do with opiates. Oh, she’s done her homework well, and she writes about every aspect of the drug—its use, its effects, and especially its personal, financial, and spiritual costs—with flesh-itching precision. But if heroin is what gives this novel its rush, Robinson’s sensitivity to family relations is what makes it so compelling.</p>

<p>“Most of the story takes place at a seaside house in Maine. For Julia, an artist and art professor, this was meant to be a tranquil vacation with her elderly parents, but those plans are quickly swept aside. On his way home from Seattle, her elder son, Steven, stops in Brooklyn to see his younger brother, Jack. Immediately, he realizes something is wrong. Drugs had always been part of Jack’s life, but now “he looked terrible; pale, very thin. Dark stubble stood out against his white skin&hellip;.Jack’s presence seemed dead, flattened. No light came from him, the air around him was inert.&ldquo; When Steven arrives at his mother&rsquo;s house, he reluctantly tells her what he suspects. Julia calls her ex-husband, who brings Jack to the house in Maine, and together the whole family begins a faltering, panicked process of intervention, counseling, and treatment that absorbs all their lives.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;To choose beauty, to insist on it, this was a large gesture.&lsquo; Julia, an artist and divorced mother of two grown sons, inspires this perception in one of many transforming moments in this piercing novel of loss, in which choosing beauty (manifest in Robinson’s gorgeous prose) is crucial to survival. The author of <em>Sweetwater</em> (2003) and several short-story collections, Robinson subtly conflates nature and human concerns as a crisis brings estranged family members together at Julia’s weathered home on the coast of Maine. Jack, her younger son, has become addicted to heroin. His straight-arrow brother blames himself. Julia is in shock. Her neurosurgeon father, the source of much of the family’s angst, is secretly tormented by his exacting knowledge of what happens to the brain under the influence of opiates and Alzheimer’s, which has begun its cruel assault on his lovely, stoic wife.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;<em>Cost</em> is unusual for being as plot-driven as it is character-driven, and the assured manner in which Robinson builds toward the inevitable train wreck is matched by her acuity in bringing us inside the characters’ minds&hellip;.[Julia] gains the strength not only to bear a grievous separation from her younger son but, more significant, to question the separations she has imposed on the most intimate relationships in her life. Why, she wonders, has she done this?&hellip;Robinson has already shown us why, having exhumed the many reasons in the preceding pages. But the question remains worth asking, not only by Julia but by any of these characters—by anyone, period, still struggling to connect. With the novel’s final words, which made me catch my breath, Robinson suggests the enormous stakes involved in pursuing the answer.&rdquo;</p>
