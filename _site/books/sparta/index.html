				<p>Conrad Farrell has no family military heritage, but as a classics major at Williams College, he has encountered the powerful appeal of the Marine Corps ethic. “Semper Fidelis” comes straight from the ancient world, from Sparta, where every citizen doubled as a full-time soldier. When Conrad graduates, he joins the Marines to continue a long tradition of honor, courage, and commitment.</p>

<p>As Roxana Robinson’s new novel, <em>Sparta</em>, begins, Conrad has just returned home to Katonah, New York, after four years in Iraq, and he’s beginning to learn that something has changed in his landscape. Something has gone wrong, though things should be fine: he hasn’t been shot or wounded; he’s never had psychological troubles. But as he attempts to reconnect with his family and his girlfriend and to find his footing in the civilian world, he learns how hard it is to return to the people and places he used to love. His life becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate: he can’t imagine his future, can’t recover his past, and can’t bring himself to occupy his present. As weeks turn into months, Conrad feels himself trapped in a life that’s constrictive and incomprehensible, and he fears that his growing rage will have irreparable consequences.</p>

<p>Suspenseful, compassionate, and perceptive, <em>Sparta </em>captures the nuances of the unique estrangement that modern soldiers face as they attempt to rejoin the society they’ve fought for. Billy Collins writes that Roxana Robinson is “a master at&hellip;the work of excavating the truths about ourselves”; <em>The Washington Post</em>’s Jonathan Yardley calls her “one of our best writers.” In<em>Sparta</em>, with the powerful insight and acuity that marked her earlier books (<em>Cost</em>, <em>Sweetwater</em>, and <em>A Perfect Stranger</em>, among others), Robinson delivers her best book yet.</p>

	"The energy here, and the drama of the book, is all about the tension of inhabiting a damaged mind as it attempts to right itself, through discipline, through rage, through alcohol, through family, and through therapy. The ups and downs of that long and harrowing journey home make <em>Sparta</em> a riveting and important contribution to the literature of the Iraq War and to anti-war literature in general."

	 "Robinson’s fifth novel (following <em>Cost</em>) is a detailed examination of the inner life of a Marine returning home after combat... Robinson brings us deep inside Conrad’s soul, and inside the suffocating despair and frustration that can stalk soldiers even when they are ostensibly out of harm’s way. By letting the reader live in Conrad’s skin, Robinson creates a moving chronicle of how we fail our returning troops."

	 "Robinson tells tales of psychic maladies with spellbinding intensity and acute insight. In <em>Cost</em> (2008), she explored drug addiction; here, she occupies the PTSD-assaulted mind of an Iraq War veteran. Conrad had everything going for him as the oldest child in a loving and achieving Westchester County family. Smart, handsome, poised, and enthralled by his college studies as a classics major, he decides to seek his own <em>Sparta</em> by joining the marines, thus shocking his ‘bookish and liberal’ parents. A kind and devoted officer, Conrad is appalled to find himself not in a noble and orderly military realm but, rather, in a morass of chaos, terror, futility, and crimes against humanity. Safely home at last, he is determined to restart his life, but all his discipline and training prove worthless in contending with searing insomnia, debilitating headaches, and ungovernable anger, fear, and hypervigilance. A war hero who now feels threatened in his boyhood bedroom, let alone on the jostling, hurrying streets of New York City, Conrad seeks treatment from the VA only to become ensnarled in another form of combat. Robinson’s diligently researched and profoundly realized tale of a warrior’s trauma and his family’s struggle to help him is a beautifully incisive, respectful, suspenseful, and indicting drama of our failure to grasp the full toll of war."

	 "Roxana Robinson’s <em>Sparta</em> delicately explores the fissures between the military experience and civilian life with this portrait of a liberal northeastern family and what happens when their son, a young Marine lieutenant, returns home from Iraq irrevocably changed. This book is not simply about war but about the horror and enforced isolation of trauma, the inevitable merging of the personal and the political, and the possibilities and trials found within the bonds of familial and romantic love."

	"Just as Robinson did in her previous novels <em>Cost</em> and <em>Sweetwater</em>, <em>Sparta</em> is unapologetic in the way it gets its point across: we must always remember the human cost of the decision to enter war. No matter where you fall in the spectrum between hawk and dove, Robinson's novel is powerfully affecting and takes its place on the shelf of essential war literature."

	"Robinson’s sympathy for the deeply messed-up Conrad and his fellow vets is as impressive as her knowledge of their circumstances. How could she know what it’s like to be blown up by an IED? How does she know about the macabre jokes soldiers tell to keep themselves sane? In fact, Robinson interviewed several vets to give her book the verisimilitude it needed. Their stories must have been excruciating to hear, but they needed to be heard.

"Their stories, or at least Conrad’s story, also deserve to be told. Full of the grief and deep compassion that’s becoming Robinson’s trademark, <em>Sparta</em> is a brilliant, necessary work."

        <blockquote cite='http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-29/entertainment/39597625_1_roxana-robinson-conrad-s-novel'>
	<p>&ldquo;Pardon the pun, but Roxana Robinson’s new novel, &lsquo;<em>Sparta</em>,&rsquo; which takes us deep inside the troubled head of a Marine returning from four years of active duty in Iraq, really is a tour de force. Robinson, whose varied bibliography ranges from a biography of Georgia O’Keeffe to her preceding novel, &lsquo;Cost,&rsquo; about a family dealing with a son’s heroin addiction, surprises us again with the unexpected subject.</p>

<p>&rdquo;<em>Sparta&#39;</em> is a novel with a mission — which in a lesser writer’s hands could spell its doom. But Robinson manages to convey the difficulties of a warrior returning to society and dramatize how we fail our veterans without reducing her story to a polemic. She pulls this off by expertly deploying three literary weapons: emotional insight, moral nuance and intellectual depth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robinson has created a character to whom even liberal, antiwar Easterners can relate. Conrad Farrell is a classics major at Williams College whose thesis is on the ancient Greek warrior culture of <em>Sparta</em>. When he announces his intention to join the Marines in the spring of 2001, his parents are aghast — even though the country is not at war. &lsquo;Their family was bookish and liberal, not martial and authoritarian,&rsquo; Robinson writes. But Conrad insists that he wants &lsquo;to do something that has consequences. This is the biggest challenge I know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Fast forward to 2006. Conrad is headed home to his family’s lovely old farmhouse in Katonah, N.Y. But &lsquo;he wasn’t the person they were expecting to meet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he didn’t know how to change himself back.&rsquo; That, in a nutshell, is the returning warrior’s predicament.</p>

<p>&quot;By embedding herself in 26-year-old Conrad’s point of view, Robinson brings the tolls of war up close. She captures the terrors of flashbacks, insomnia, headaches, panic attacks, impotence, inchoate rage and suicidal thoughts — all symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD). Although no longer in danger, Conrad finds it impossible to let down his guard. He’s leery of crowds and windows. He flies into a terrifying rage when a woman’s handbag knocks into him in a crowded restaurant.</p>

<p>&quot;Unable to penetrate Conrad’s armor, his increasingly alarmed family and girlfriend keep asking, &lsquo;How are you really?&rsquo; But he finds it impossible to talk about the Iraqi children murdered in their beds or the member of his platoon trapped in a burning Humvee whose doors are welded shut by the heat of an improvised explosive device — never mind his mounting doubts about the mission.</p>

<p>&quot;Robinson replays these horrors in a torturous loop. While it is remarkable how many ways she finds to describe panic attacks — &lsquo;hovering over him like a tornado funnel,&rsquo; as if on perpetual night guard duty — her portrait of PTSD is so relentless that it occasionally threatens to overwhelm not just her character but her novel. Conrad feels his platoon’s absence &lsquo;like a phantom limb&rsquo; and tries to keep in e-mail touch with his men. But he holds that Marines don’t complain, and so he pushes himself to prepare for graduate school despite his escalating despair. He quickly wears out his welcome at his girlfriend’s and sister’s New York apartments.</p>

<p>&quot;As she prepared to write this novel, Robinson talked to a number of Iraq war veterans and read Sebastian Junger’s &lsquo;War,&rsquo; Dexter Filkins’s &lsquo;The Forever War&rsquo; and Anthony Swofford’s &lsquo;Jarhead&rsquo; among others. Her explanation of the mishandled early missions in Fallujah and the clash between the long-ruling minority Sunnis and the majority Shiites is as clear as any I’ve read. So, too, is her fascinating primer on the severe and ultimately doomed warrior culture of <em>Sparta</em>, which provides an underlying cautionary tale for her book.</p>

<p>&quot;But it’s Robinson’s portrait of the Veterans Affairs system that is most devastating. When Conrad becomes desperate enough to seek help, the response is outrageously inadequate. He finally gains entry after waiting four months, only to meet for a few minutes with a distracted doctor who hands him a fistful of prescriptions — most with suicidal side effects — and tells him to get back to him in three months. It’s appalling. &lsquo;He’d thought that there was some sort of compact — wasn’t there? He was offering his life for his country, and his country would be there when he came home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Robinson demonstrated her deftness in handling the dynamics of a family under duress in &lsquo;Cost.&rsquo; In &lsquo;<em>Sparta</em>,&rsquo; the Farrells are a more congenial, highly functional bunch who are nonetheless stymied by Conrad’s condition. One small reservation about Robinson’s otherwise convincing scenario: It seems astonishing that his father, a law professor, and his mother, a family therapist, wouldn’t have done a little research into what their son was going through and intervened to make sure he got help.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be wonderful if &lsquo;<em>Sparta&rsquo;</em> led to improvements in mental-health care for veterans, but at the very least, it is bound to add understanding to their plight. Although too carefully wrought to be called improvised, Robinson’s powerful novel demonstrates that fiction actually can function as a sort of explosive device.&rdquo;</p>
