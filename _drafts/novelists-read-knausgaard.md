Volume 1, January 25 led by Roxana Robinson

Since the first volume of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s sprawling work appeared in English in 2012, the series has garnered wide acclaim from critics and attracted a passionate following among readers. “My Struggle” has also been notably embraced and celebrated by Knausgaard’s fellow novelists. Rachel Cusk called it “perhaps the most significant literary enterprise of our times.” Beyond its vast length and digressive structure, “My Struggle” presents a number of challenges to the reader, blurring the line between fact and fiction, questioning our ideas about what subjects are suitable for fiction, and pushing the boundary where revelatory introspection ends and self-absorption begins.

With all of that in mind, we invite you to join a special reading group devoted to this unique work. Once a month, from January to May, the group will meet to consider, in sequence, the five volumes so far translated into English. Each discussion will be led by a distinguished novelist. Whether you are a first-time reader of “My Struggle” or a devoted Knausgaardian, this group will provide a rewarding forum for debate, insight, and new discoveries.
